The UberBots' website code
==========================

Introduction
------------

This website contains (some) of the source code for the Uberbots's (FRC Team #1124) `beta website <http://beta.uberbots.org>`_.

It is currently in the process of being updated, so please excuse any broken links, outdated information, etc. Opening issues and notifying the webmaster of problems that you find with the website would be appreciated, as the website development team probably doesnt know about said :strike:`bugs` features yet.

Contributing to the website
---------------------------

If you are interested in contributing to the beta website, all you need to do is join the "Programmers" team (descriptive, right?) clone into the repo, muck around, and push your changes- we have a nice script which (should) update the website with your changes automatically.

If the repo admins never get around to updating the repo webhooks to make this script work then you can update the site manually by `launching and reloading this page <http://uberbots.org/beta/github_sync.php>`_.
