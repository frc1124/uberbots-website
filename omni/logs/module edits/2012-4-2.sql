Then we have six weeks (know as build season) to plan, build, and program a robot for our team. After build season, we compete in the Connecticut Regional (and The WPI Regional in 2010 actually) and the international championship in Atlanta, GA (but in 2011, it''s going to be in St. Louis, MO). Outside of this "season" between Kickoff and the Championship, we do dozens of community demos and fundraisers to build awareness about science, technology, and robotics.\n<p style="clear:both;">\n\n<h2 style="color:#002699">how we do it</h2>\n<img src="/omni/media/sponsors/utcfireandsecurity.png" style="float:left;padding-right:5px;">Building our robot as well as building our team requires mechanical, programming, engineering, business, marketing, and leadership skills, which our members learn and develop on the team thanks to experienced team members and our adult leaders and mentors. We would be nowhere without our sponsors and mentors. The knowledge and support of our mentors are what makes the program so fun and educational. Most importantly, we would like to thank UTC Fire and Security who helps more than anybody to make our team possible. For more information, please visit our <a href="about/our_mentors">Mentor</a> and <a href="about/our_sponsors">Sponsor</a> page.\n<p style="clear:both;">\n\n<h2 style="color:#002699">why we do it</h2>\n<img src="http://www.uberbots.org/omni/media/firstlogo.gif" style="float:right;padding-left:5px;">\nWe spend all this time building a robot as well as our team to work to spread the ideals of FIRST around our community. We work to help make true FIRST''s vision: <i>"To transform our culture by creating a world where science and technology are celebrated."</i> In addition, we work <i>"to inspire young people to be science and technology leaders"</i> through exposure to science, technology, and gracious professionalism which we accomplish both within the team and outside it through our numerous community demos and fundraisers.

(20, 'code', '<h2 style="color:#bf0000; font-weight:bold">2002: Year One -</h2>\nIn 2002, a group of students at Avon High School started a FIRST robotics team called "The Cheetahs," as our main sponsor then was Cheetah Learning. \n<br>\n<h2 style="color:#bf0000; font-weight:bold">2003: First Competition</h2>\nWe competed in our first competition in 2003, "Stack Attack," and were ranked 9th and were eliminated in the quarter finals. We also won the Rookie All-Star award. Things were starting out great!\n<br>\n<h2 style="color:#bf0000; font-weight:bold">2004: The ÃœberBots!</h2>\nThough our name was different, we were UberBots at heart, and we changed our name to the UberBots in the fall of 2004. We participated in the 2004 competition, "Raising the Bar," where we were ranked 27th and didn''t make it into elimination. However, we competed at Bash at the Beach that year, an off-season competition hosted by the Techno Ticks, and were on the winning alliance.\n<br>\n<h2 style="color:#bf0000; font-weight:bold">2005: Triple Play</h2>\nIn 2005 we competed in the game "Triple Play" and were ranked 10th, eliminated in the quarter finals.\n<br>\n<h2 style="color:#bf0000; font-weight:bold">2006: Off to Atlanta</h2>\nIn 2006, we decided to build a robot that could do everything-play defense, and score in the upper and lower goals in that year''s game, "Aim High." Though we thought we may have over-extended ourselves, everyone was supportive and helped make last-minute changes at competition. After our final seeding match we were ranked 34th, but teams 177 (Bobcat Robotics of South Windsor) and 176 (Aces High from Suffield and Windsor Locks High Schools) had faith in our team and chose us to be their alliance partner. With a lot of team work and a little luck, the UberBots and our alliance partners battled our way to the top to win the UTC New England regional.\n<br>\n<br>\nOur regional win that year qualified us for the 2006 national competition in Atlanta, and the long haul from Connecticut was definitely worth it. The memories created there will be with the team forever. The UberBots also competed in Battlecry @ WPI in June, and Bash @ the Beach in October, an offseason event that we participate in to this day. The Bash @ the Beach was a great competition for our team because it allowed us to work in a competitive yet low-key environment with the new year''s team, as it takes place in October. We allied with teams 190 (Gompei Herd of Worchester, MA) and 500 (Waterford''s Team USA) and placed second. We also received an "All Business" award commending "the team that is most serious about their robotics and their fun."\n<br>\n<h2 style="color:#bf0000; font-weight:bold">2007: Time to Rack ''n'' Roll</h2>\nRiding our success in 2006, we decided to build another multi-functional robot for the 2007 competition, "Rank ''n'' Roll." Our robot, which we named "Dynamite" included a 2-joint arm (with a "wrist" and "shoulder" motor and a gripper for a hand) which gave us great flexibility since we could both score by putting tubes on the rack and get points back by removing "spoiler" game pieces. Dynamite also had a set of deployable ramps long enough to hold two robots, which earned us bonus points. Dynamite also had heft bumpers that allowed us to play defense if we needed to, and an autonomous mode with 16 different functions that allowed us to automatically raise Dynamite''s arm to different heights and other useful things.\n<br>\n<br>\nWe were able to "Rack ''n'' Roll" our way to the top, finishing as an alliance captain (in the top 8), and we ultimately won the UTC Connecticut Regional with team 195 (the CyberKnights of Southington) and team 558 (the RoboSquad from New Haven). For the second year in a row, we traveled to Atlanta to compete in the nationals, ending up in the Newton division again. This time, however, we were ranked third after the division seeding matches, and allied with  teams 1592 (the Bionic Tigers from Cocoa, FL) and 1816 (The Green Machine, all the way from Edina, Minnesota!). Our powerful alliance brought us all the way to the division finals. The UberBots continued to Einstein as the backup bot for Newton''s champion. After the Championship, we competed at Battlecry @ WPI, hosted by team 190, where we seeded 1st for the first time ever.\n<br>\n'),

We also won the Rookie All-Star award. Things were starting out great!\n<br>\n<h2 style="color:#bf0000; font-weight:bold">2004: The ÃœberBots!</h2>\nThough our name was different, we were UberBots at heart, and we changed our name to the UberBots in the fall of 2004. We participated in the 2004 competition, "Raising the Bar," where we were ranked 27th and didn''t make it into elimination. However, we competed at Bash at the Beach that year, an off-season competition hosted by the Techno Ticks, and were on the winning alliance.\n<br>\n<h2 style="color:#bf0000; font-weight:bold">2005: Triple Play</h2>\nIn 2005 we competed in the game "Triple Play" and were ranked 10th, eliminated in the quarter finals.\n<br>\n<h2 style="color:#bf0000; font-weight:bold">2006: Off to Atlanta</h2>\nIn 2006, we decided to build a robot that could do everything-play defense, and score in the upper and lower goals in that year''s game, "Aim High." Though we thought we may have over-extended ourselves, everyone was supportive and helped make last-minute changes at competition. After our final seeding match we were ranked 34th, but teams 177 (Bobcat Robotics of South Windsor) and 176 (Aces High from Suffield and Windsor Locks High Schools) had faith in our team and chose us to be their alliance partner. With a lot of team work and a little luck, the UberBots and our alliance partners battled our way to the top to win the UTC New England regional.\n<br>\n<br>\nOur regional win that year qualified us for the 2006 national competition in Atlanta, and the long haul from Connecticut was definitely worth it. The memories created there will be with the team forever. The UberBots also competed in Battlecry @ WPI in June, and Bash @ the Beach in October, an offseason event that we participate in to this day. The Bash @ the Beach was a great competition for our team because it allowed us to work in a competitive yet low-key environment with the new year''s team, as it takes place in October. We allied with teams 190 (Gompei Herd of Worchester, MA) and 500 (Waterford''s Team USA) and placed second. We also received an "All Business" award commending "the team that is most serious about their robotics and their fun."\n<br>\n<h2 style="color:#bf0000; font-weight:bold">2007: Time to Rack ''n'' Roll</h2>\nRiding our success in 2006, we decided to build another multi-functional robot for the 2007 competition, "Rank ''n'' Roll." Our robot, which we named "Dynamite" included a 2-joint arm (with a "wrist" and "shoulder" motor and a gripper for a hand) which gave us great flexibility since we could both score by putting tubes on the rack and get points back by removing "spoiler" game pieces. Dynamite also had a set of deployable ramps long enough to hold two robots, which earned us bonus points. Dynamite also had heft bumpers that allowed us to play defense if we needed to, and an autonomous mode with 16 different functions that allowed us to automatically raise Dynamite''s arm to different heights and other useful things.\n<br>\n<br>\nWe were able to "Rack ''n'' Roll" our way to the top, finishing as an alliance captain (in the top 8), and we ultimately won the UTC Connecticut Regional with team 195 (the CyberKnights of Southington) and team 558 (the RoboSquad from New Haven). For the second year in a row, we traveled to Atlanta to compete in the nationals, ending up in the Newton division again. This time, however, we were ranked third after the division seeding matches, and allied with  teams 1592 (the Bionic Tigers from Cocoa, FL) and 1816 (The Green Machine, all the way from Edina, Minnesota!). Our powerful alliance brought us all the way to the division finals. The UberBots continued to Einstein as the backup bot for Newton''s champion. After the Championship, we competed at Battlecry @ WPI, hosted by team 190, where we seeded 1st for the first time ever.\n<br>\n');

(42, 'code', '<h1>About Our Team</h1>\n<h2 style="color:#bf0000; font-weight:bold">2002: Year One</h2>\nIn 2002, a group of students at Avon High School started a FIRST robotics team called "The Cheetahs," as our main sponsor then was Cheetah Learning. \n<br>\n<h2 style="color:#bf0000; font-weight:bold">2003: First Competition</h2>\nWe competed in our first competition in 2003, "Stack Attack," and were ranked 9th and were eliminated in the quarter finals. We also won the Rookie All-Star award. Things were starting out great!\n<br>\n<h2 style="color:#bf0000; font-weight:bold">2004: The ÃœberBots!</h2>\nThough our name was different, we were UberBots at heart, and we changed our name to the UberBots in the fall of 2004. We participated in the 2004 competition, "Raising the Bar," where we were ranked 27th and didn''t make it into elimination. However, we competed at Bash at the Beach that year, an off-season competition hosted by the Techno Ticks, and were on the winning alliance.\n<br>\n<h2 style="color:#bf0000; font-weight:bold">2005: Triple Play</h2>\nIn 2005 we competed in the game "Triple Play" and were ranked 10th, eliminated in the quarter finals.\n<br>\n<h2 style="color:#bf0000; font-weight:bold">2006: Off to Atlanta</h2>\nIn 2006, we decided to build a robot that could do everything-play defense, and score in the upper and lower goals in that year''s game, "Aim High." Though we thought we may have over-extended ourselves, everyone was supportive and helped make last-minute changes at competition. After our final seeding match we were ranked 34th, but teams 177 (Bobcat Robotics of South Windsor) and 176 (Aces High from Suffield and Windsor Locks High Schools) had faith in our team and chose us to be their alliance partner. With a lot of team work and a little luck, the UberBots and our alliance partners battled our way to the top to win the UTC New England regional.\n<br>\n<br>\nOur regional win that year qualified us for the 2006 national competition in Atlanta, and the long haul from Connecticut was definitely worth it. The memories created there will be with the team forever. The UberBots also competed in Battlecry @ WPI in June, and Bash @ the Beach in October, an offseason event that we participate in to this day. The Bash @ the Beach was a great competition for our team because it allowed us to work in a competitive yet low-key environment with the new year''s team, as it takes place in October. We allied with teams 190 (Gompei Herd of Worchester, MA) and 500 (Waterford''s Team USA) and placed second. We also received an "All Business" award commending "the team that is most serious about their robotics and their fun."\n<br>\n<h2 style="color:#bf0000; font-weight:bold">2007: Time to Rack ''n'' Roll</h2>\nRiding our success in 2006, we decided to build another multi-functional robot for the 2007 competition, "Rank ''n'' Roll." Our robot, which we named "Dynamite" included a 2-joint arm (with a "wrist" and "shoulder" motor and a gripper for a hand) which gave us great flexibility since we could both score by putting tubes on the rack and get points back by removing "spoiler" game pieces. Dynamite also had a set of deployable ramps long enough to hold two robots, which earned us bonus points. Dynamite also had heft bumpers that allowed us to play defense if we needed to, and an autonomous mode with 16 different functions that allowed us to automatically raise Dynamite''s arm to different heights and other useful things.\n<br>\n<br>\nWe were able to "Rack ''n'' Roll" our way to the top, finishing as an alliance captain (in the top 8), and we ultimately won the UTC Connecticut Regional with team 195 (the CyberKnights of Southington) and team 558 (the RoboSquad from New Haven). For the second year in a row, we traveled to Atlanta to compete in the nationals, ending up in the Newton division again. This time, however, we were ranked third after the division seeding matches, and allied with  teams 1592 (the Bionic Tigers from Cocoa, FL) and 1816 (The Green Machine, all the way from Edina, Minnesota!). Our powerful alliance brought us all the way to the division finals. The UberBots continued to Einstein as the backup bot for Newton''s champion. After the Championship, we competed at Battlecry @ WPI, hosted by team 190, where we seeded 1st for the first time ever.\n<br>\n'),

Then we have six weeks (know as build season) to plan, build, and program a robot for our team. After build season, we compete in the Connecticut Regional (and The WPI Regional in 2010 actually) and the international championship in Atlanta, GA (but in 2011, it''s going to be in St. Louis, MO). Outside of this "season" between Kickoff and the Championship, we do dozens of community demos and fundraisers to build awareness about science, technology, and robotics.\n<p style="clear:both;">\n\n<h2 style="color:#002699">how we do it</h2>\n<img src="/omni/media/sponsors/utcfireandsecurity.png" style="float:left;padding-right:5px;">Building our robot as well as building our team requires mechanical, programming, engineering, business, marketing, and leadership skills, which our members learn and develop on the team thanks to experienced team members and our adult leaders and mentors. We would be nowhere without our sponsors and mentors. The knowledge and support of our mentors are what makes the program so fun and educational. Most importantly, we would like to thank UTC Fire and Security who helps more than anybody to make our team possible. For more information, please visit our <a href="about/our_mentors">Mentors</a> and <a href="about/our_sponsors">Sponsors</a> pages.\n<p style="clear:both;">\n\n<h2 style="color:#002699">why we do it</h2>\n<img src="http://www.uberbots.org/omni/media/firstlogo.gif" style="float:right;padding-left:5px;">\nWe spend all this time building a robot as well as our team to work to spread the ideals of FIRST around our community. We work to help make true FIRST''s vision: <i>"To transform our culture by creating a world where science and technology are celebrated."</i> In addition, we work <i>"to inspire young people to be science and technology leaders"</i> through exposure to science, technology, and gracious professionalism which we accomplish both within the team and outside it through our numerous community demos and fundraisers.

Hopefully this "post" will help future management teams get off the ground running!\n\n[b]Mass Emails:[/b]\nIf your team doesn''t know when an event is happening, how could any members possibly show up? Questions like this are exactly why the UberBots mass email system exists. When an event is about a month away, send a mass email letting parents and team members know what is going on.

All throughout morning we had many interested parents whose younger children were very interested in the program.\nWe visited every booth and dropped off a brochure and a spoke about our program. In addition to the brochure we drove the 2008 robot past all of the booths using the inverter, which attracted quite a few people to our booth. \nWe presented on stage from 3-3:30 with a captive audience, Lauren, Justin, Matt H, and I spoke about FIRST, preseason, build season, awards, and how people can support our team.\nAs for team members in attendance we had 7 or 8 that stayed all day and a few who stopped by either in the morning or in the afternoon.\n\nMoving to our To Do list for this week... Here are a few keys things we need to focus on:\n1. Management members attending the school activities fair TOMORROW during all four lunches.\n2.Entrance basket for B@B, what to include, where to get it from.\n3. Driver selection for B@B, hopefully Thursday night we can have a Driver Tryout and select 2 or 3 teams of drivers for the event.\n4. Double check with Mr. Sunblade about our transportation situation\n5. Fundraisers and the trip along Route 44 for donations, this needs to be arranged asap. (I have compiled an Assets/Liabilities spreadsheet for usto discuss at some point...)\n6. Registering for the regional (Opens September 30th, and i don''t think we [the students] can do that)\n\nJust as a side note, Ameya, can you either post the minutes for Avon Day or use a derivation of the notes above?\n\nThanks,\n\nName Here"[/size]\n\n\n\nThat''s most of what I have learned so far, from being on the management team for a few months.

(70, 'code', '<h1>About Our Team</h1>\n<h2 style="color:#bf0000; font-weight:bold">2002: Year One</h2>\nIn 2002, a group of students at Avon High School started a FIRST robotics team called "The Cheetahs," as our main sponsor then was Cheetah Learning. \n<br>\n<h2 style="color:#bf0000; font-weight:bold">2003: First Competition</h2>\nWe competed in our first competition in 2003, "Stack Attack," and were ranked 9th and were eliminated in the quarter finals. We also won the Rookie All-Star award. Things were starting out great!\n<br>\n<h2 style="color:#bf0000; font-weight:bold">2004: The ÃœberBots!</h2>\nThough our name was different, we were UberBots at heart, and we changed our name to the UberBots in the fall of 2004. We participated in the 2004 competition, "Raising the Bar," where we were ranked 27th and didn''t make it into elimination. However, we competed at Bash at the Beach that year, an off-season competition hosted by the Techno Ticks, and were on the winning alliance.\n<br>\n<h2 style="color:#bf0000; font-weight:bold">2005: Triple Play</h2>\nIn 2005 we competed in the game "Triple Play" and were ranked 10th, eliminated in the quarter finals.\n<br>\n<h2 style="color:#bf0000; font-weight:bold">2006: Off to Atlanta</h2>\nIn 2006, we decided to build a robot that could do everything-play defense, and score in the upper and lower goals in that year''s game, "Aim High." Though we thought we may have over-extended ourselves, everyone was supportive and helped make last-minute changes at competition. After our final seeding match we were ranked 34th, but teams 177 (Bobcat Robotics of South Windsor) and 176 (Aces High from Suffield and Windsor Locks High Schools) had faith in our team and chose us to be their alliance partner. With a lot of team work and a little luck, the UberBots and our alliance partners battled our way to the top to win the UTC New England regional.\n<br>\n<br>\nOur regional win that year qualified us for the 2006 national competition in Atlanta, and the long haul from Connecticut was definitely worth it. The memories created there will be with the team forever. The UberBots also competed in Battlecry @ WPI in June, and Bash @ the Beach in October, an offseason event that we participate in to this day. The Bash @ the Beach was a great competition for our team because it allowed us to work in a competitive yet low-key environment with the new year''s team, as it takes place in October. We allied with teams 190 (Gompei Herd of Worchester, MA) and 500 (Waterford''s Team USA) and placed second. We also received an "All Business" award commending "the team that is most serious about their robotics and their fun."\n<br>\n<h2 style="color:#bf0000; font-weight:bold">2007: Time to Rack ''n'' Roll</h2>\nRiding our success in 2006, we decided to build another multi-functional robot for the 2007 competition, "Rank ''n'' Roll." Our robot, which we named "Dynamite" included a 2-joint arm (with a "wrist" and "shoulder" motor and a gripper for a hand) which gave us great flexibility since we could both score by putting tubes on the rack and get points back by removing "spoiler" game pieces. Dynamite also had a set of deployable ramps long enough to hold two robots, which earned us bonus points. Dynamite also had heft bumpers that allowed us to play defense if we needed to, and an autonomous mode with 16 different functions that allowed us to automatically raise Dynamite''s arm to different heights and other useful things.\n<br>\n<br>\nWe were able to "Rack ''n'' Roll" our way to the top, finishing as an alliance captain (in the top 8), and we ultimately won the UTC Connecticut Regional with team 195 (the CyberKnights of Southington) and team 558 (the RoboSquad from New Haven). For the second year in a row, we traveled to Atlanta to compete in the nationals, ending up in the Newton division again. This time, however, we were ranked third after the division seeding matches, and allied with  teams 1592 (the Bionic Tigers from Cocoa, FL) and 1816 (The Green Machine, all the way from Edina, Minnesota!). Our powerful alliance brought us all the way to the division finals. The UberBots continued to Einstein as the backup bot for Newton''s champion. After the Championship, we competed at Battlecry @ WPI, hosted by team 190, where we seeded 1st for the first time ever.\n<br>\n'),

His goal was to expose students of all ages to science and technology in such a way that they would become inspired to become scientists and engineers in the future.  Kamen worked with MIT mechanical engineering professor Dr. Woodie Flowers to create the first ever FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) at a New Hampshire high school in 1992.  From that point on, FIRST has grown to be one the largest robotics competitions in the world.  The program has over 250,000 students working on 22,600 robots with the assistance of over 68,000 mentors and 33,000 volunteers from all disciplines such as engineering, fund raising, and team leadership (project value, usfirst.org).  The program also expands beyond US borders to over ten countries like Israel, Brazil, Japan, and even Australia.[/color]\n\n[color=#002699][i]FIRST[/i] have four main levels of competition: Junior [i]FIRST[/i] Lego League for ages 6-9 (JFLL), [i]FIRST[/i] Lego League for students in grades 4-8(FLL), [i]FIRST[/i] Tech Challenge for students grades 9-12 (FTC), and The [i]FIRST[/i] Robotics Competition, also for high school aged students (FRC).  The [Uml][/Uml]berBots compete on the FRC level, which is also the largest level of competition.  Around the first or second week in January, [i]FIRST[/i] releases a challenge for FRC students as well as a rule book with very specific details concerning the size of the robot, details about game play, and more.  Students then have six weeks to design, build, and program their robots in order to be shipped by a certain date.  After ship date, students are not allowed to touch their robot until competition, where they compete on an international level.  The winners of each of these "regional" events moves onto the Championship tournament in St. Louis, Missouri.  This allows FRC to always been exciting, for no two games are ever the same.  Starting from the end of the Championship event, the FRC Game Design Committee (GDC) starts working hard on the next game so it''s almost perfect by kickoff (there are always constant updates being made, even between regional competitions).[/color]'),

Having a modular website would replace the older system of individually coding pages from scratch. This system scatters code and makes it more difficult to program and maintain.  When pages include modules, or building blocks, it will make it much easier to build and keep a quality website. <br/>\nThe OmniPage system uses modules to keep content. Modules are building blocks for the website: a block of predefined code that serves a specific purpose. Different modules on the website keep content in a logical place and make for an overall better website and browsing experience.<br/><a href="#top">Top of Page</a></p>\n\n<a name=''integrated''><h2>Integrated</h2></a>\n<p><img src=''http://uberbots.org/omni/media/integrated.png'' style="float:left;padding-right:5px;" alt=''integrated''/>The OmniPage system is integrated with many current technologies. First, the website is integrated with the UberBots <a href="http://uberbots.org/forums">Forums</a>, which provide login credentials and simplified permissions for administrative functions. This concept increases efficiency by only having the website files deal with one set of credentials and user properties. This not only reduces coding on the programming end, but also makes people only have to remember one set of login information. This integration will also simplify the ability to link calendar events to forum posts, for easily accessible meeting minutes and other information and discussion regarding meetings and events.<br/>\nThe website is also integrated with other websites and technologies. It helps to create a better website by helping people stay connected and informed with team happenings (see <a href="http://uberbots.org/o/about/our_website/advantages#communication">here</a>).

The website should look and function well in all major browsers, including Microsoft Internet Explorer (at least version 7), Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, Apple Safari, and Opera.

(131, 'code', '<h1>The Advantages of the OmniPage System</h1>\n<p>The OmniPage system makes it very easy to edit content on the site. Although the site may look normal based on its final output, there is actually a lot of complex code going on behind the scenes to make the administrator''s job a lot easier. </p>\n\n<a name=''pages''><h2>Pages</h2></a>\n<p>Pages in this system are stored in the database. The OmniCore will find the correct page in the database, and return all of the content associated with that page. Having pages stored in the database makes it very easy to create pages, modify their properties, and delete them. Below is the form for creating a page.\n<img src=''http://uberbots.org/omni/media/addPage.png'' alt=''add page form''/></p>\n\n<a name=''modules''><h2>Modules</h2></a>\n<p><img src=''http://uberbots.org/omni/media/editbox.png'' alt=''edit page dropdown box'' style="float:right;padding-left:5px;"/>Adding and modifying content on a page is very easy to do, and does not require knowledge of HTML or PHP. All that is required is the addition of a module, is for the user to click on the edit button at the top of the page and select "Add Module." The user then picks which module type to add and selects it. <br/>Modules are also very easy to edit. And administrator simply has to select "Edit Module" from the drop down box and select the module to edit. Then, a graphical method of editing the module will appear, as determined in the module PHP file. Then, once the edit has been made, the new information will be updated in the database.<br/>Administrators also have the ability to review edits made to a module. They can view past states of modules and revert to that state if necessary. All edits are stored in the database along with other information related to that edit, including the user, time, IP, and previous content. <br/>\nThis ability to easily edit content on the site is very important. It makes it so editing and maintaining the website is no longer a role for someone who knows HTML. Now, the website content is no longer directly tied to the source file, making for an easily modifiable and modular experience while using the site. \n</p>\n\n<a name=''skins''><h2>Skins</h2></a>\n<p>The OmniPage system is also a skinnable system. The ability to use skins makes it much easier to change the website''s design. Previously, the programmers would have to completely change how the site works in the very low level files in order to change the formatting. With the OmniPage skin system, changing how the site looks is simply a matter of editing a skin file. Skin files are HTML, CSS, and Javascript files that manage how the site appears to the user. These files are passed dynamic content through the module files via special functions. This content is then displayed in the skin and shown to the end user. Now, when the website team would like to change how the site looks, they simply have to create a new skin with all the necessary files, instead of recoding the site. Skins can also be used to provide a dynamic viewing experience. A special skin can be used to simply shake things up or to make the site mobile device friendly. Either way, the ability to have skins is an important feature of the OmniPage system.</p>\n\n<a name=''communication''><h2>Communication</h2></a>\n<p><a href="http://facebook.com/TheUberBots"><img src="http://uberbots.org/omni/media/facebook.png" style="float:right;padding-left:5px;"/></a>\nThe OmniPage system also integrates communication with team members into its architecture. There is native support for emailing all team members, as well as other groups of users (as determined through the forums). The website also supports sending out mass SMS messages to those who signed up. The website will automatically send out a mass SMS 24 hours before any event on the calendar, ensuring team members are informed about upcoming events. These features come in handy for alerting team members to news regarding the team.<br/>\nThe OmniCore is also integrated with social networking. The UberBots <a href=''http://twitter.com/team1124''>Twitter</a> Account and <a href="http://facebook.com/TheUberBots">Facebook</a> fanpage are linked to the website, making is easy to update both.<br/><a href="http://twitter.com/team1124"><img src="http://uberbots.org/omni/media/twitter.png" /></a</p>\n\n<a name=''security''><h2>Security</h2></a>\n<p>The OmniPage also has native security features. All user accounts are integrated with the UberBots phpBB <a href="http://uberbots.org/forums">forums</a>. Having this integration removes the hassle of team members having multiple accounts (for both main site and forums), a problem encountered in previous websites. The usage of forums accounts created an "all in one" user account that works for the entire UberBots website. <br/>Using the forums accounts also provides simple security features. PhpBB has native usergroups, which the OmniCore uses to decide whether a user can see or edit a certain page. Some groups have global permissions while others can only deal with certain pages. Administrators also have the ability to give certain users or groups special permissions (that aren''t native) for certain pages. This helps with maintaining website content; now any user can be responsible for a certain page and make sure it''s up to date. This system also ensures security with regard to editing content.<br/>\nThe OmniPage system also has native log features. When an administrative action is carried out, the system will automatically append an entry to a log text file with important information regarding the edit.

(141, 'code', '<a name=''top''><h1>The Advantages of the OmniPage System</h1></a>\n<p>The OmniPage system makes it very easy to edit content on the site. Although the site may look normal based on its final output, there is actually a lot of complex code going on behind the scenes to make the administrator''s job a lot easier. </p>\n\n<p><ul>\n<li><a href="#pages">Pages</a></li>\n<li><a href="#modules">Modules</a></li>\n<li><a href="#skins">Skins</a></li>\n<li><a href="#communication">Communication</a></li>\n<li><a href="#security">Security</a></li>\n</ul></p>\n\n<p>Retrn to <a href=''http://uberbots.org/o/about/our_website''>About Our Website</a> page</p>\n\n<a name=''pages''><h2>Pages</h2></a>\n<p>Pages in this system are stored in the database. The OmniCore will find the correct page in the database, and return all of the content associated with that page. Having pages stored in the database makes it very easy to create pages, modify their properties, and delete them. Below is the form for creating a page.\n<img src=''http://uberbots.org/omni/media/addPage.png'' alt=''add page form''/><br/><a href="#top">Top of Page</a></p>\n\n<a name=''modules''><h2>Modules</h2></a>\n<p><img src=''http://uberbots.org/omni/media/editbox.png'' alt=''edit page dropdown box'' style="float:right;padding-left:5px;"/>Adding and modifying content on a page is very easy to do, and does not require knowledge of HTML or PHP. All that is required is the addition of a module, is for the user to click on the edit button at the top of the page and select "Add Module." The user then picks which module type to add and selects it. <br/>Modules are also very easy to edit. And administrator simply has to select "Edit Module" from the drop down box and select the module to edit. Then, a graphical method of editing the module will appear, as determined in the module PHP file. Then, once the edit has been made, the new information will be updated in the database.<br/>Administrators also have the ability to review edits made to a module. They can view past states of modules and revert to that state if necessary. All edits are stored in the database along with other information related to that edit, including the user, time, IP, and previous content. <br/>\nThis ability to easily edit content on the site is very important. It makes it so editing and maintaining the website is no longer a role for someone who knows HTML. Now, the website content is no longer directly tied to the source file, making for an easily modifiable and modular experience while using the site. <br/><a href="#top">Top of Page</a>\n</p>\n\n<a name=''skins''><h2>Skins</h2></a>\n<p>The OmniPage system is also a skinnable system. The ability to use skins makes it much easier to change the website''s design. Previously, the programmers would have to completely change how the site works in the very low level files in order to change the formatting. With the OmniPage skin system, changing how the site looks is simply a matter of editing a skin file. Skin files are HTML, CSS, and Javascript files that manage how the site appears to the user. These files are passed dynamic content through the module files via special functions. This content is then displayed in the skin and shown to the end user. Now, when the website team would like to change how the site looks, they simply have to create a new skin with all the necessary files, instead of recoding the site. Skins can also be used to provide a dynamic viewing experience. A special skin can be used to simply shake things up or to make the site mobile device friendly. Either way, the ability to have skins is an important feature of the OmniPage system.<br/><a href="#top">Top of Page</a></p>\n\n<a name=''communication''><h2>Communication</h2></a>\n<p><a href="http://facebook.com/TheUberBots"><img src="http://uberbots.org/omni/media/facebook.png" style="float:right;padding-left:5px;"/></a>\nThe OmniPage system also integrates communication with team members into its architecture. There is native support for emailing all team members, as well as other groups of users (as determined through the forums). The website also supports sending out mass SMS messages to those who signed up. The website will automatically send out a mass SMS 24 hours before any event on the calendar, ensuring team members are informed about upcoming events. These features come in handy for alerting team members to news regarding the team.<br/>\nThe OmniCore is also integrated with social networking. The UberBots <a href=''http://twitter.com/team1124''>Twitter</a> Account and <a href="http://facebook.com/TheUberBots">Facebook</a> fanpage are linked to the website, making is easy to update both.<br/><a href="http://twitter.com/team1124"><img src="http://uberbots.org/omni/media/twitter.png" /></a><br/><a href="#top">Top of Page</a></p>\n\n<a name=''security''><h2>Security</h2></a>\n<p>The OmniPage also has native security features. All user accounts are integrated with the UberBots phpBB <a href="http://uberbots.org/forums">forums</a>. Having this integration removes the hassle of team members having multiple accounts (for both main site and forums), a problem encountered in previous websites. The usage of forums accounts created an "all in one" user account that works for the entire UberBots website. <br/>Using the forums accounts also provides simple security features. PhpBB has native usergroups, which the OmniCore uses to decide whether a user can see or edit a certain page. Some groups have global permissions while others can only deal with certain pages. Administrators also have the ability to give certain users or groups special permissions (that aren''t native) for certain pages. This helps with maintaining website content; now any user can be responsible for a certain page and make sure it''s up to date. This system also ensures security with regard to editing content.<br/>\nThe OmniPage system also has native log features. When an administrative action is carried out, the system will automatically append an entry to a log text file with important information regarding the edit. Username, time, and the action are recorded. This record of events helps ensure security with administrative features.<br/><a href="#top">Top of Page</a></p>\n'),

(146, 'code', '<h1>About Our Team</h1>\n<h2 style="color:#bf0000; font-weight:bold">2002: Year One</h2>\nIn 2002, a group of students at Avon High School started a FIRST robotics team called "The Cheetahs," as our main sponsor then was Cheetah Learning. \n<br>\n<h2 style="color:#bf0000; font-weight:bold">2003: First Competition</h2>\nWe competed in our first competition in 2003, "Stack Attack," and were ranked 9th and were eliminated in the quarter finals. We also won the Rookie All-Star award. Things were starting out great!\n<br>\n<h2 style="color:#bf0000; font-weight:bold">2004: The ÃœberBots!</h2>\nThough our name was different, we were UberBots at heart, and we changed our name to the UberBots in the fall of 2004. We participated in the 2004 competition, "Raising the Bar," where we were ranked 27th and didn''t make it into elimination. However, we competed at Bash at the Beach that year, an off-season competition hosted by the Techno Ticks, and were on the winning alliance.\n<br>\n<h2 style="color:#bf0000; font-weight:bold">2005: Triple Play</h2>\nIn 2005 we competed in the game "Triple Play" and were ranked 10th, eliminated in the quarter finals.\n<br>\n<h2 style="color:#bf0000; font-weight:bold">2006: Off to Atlanta</h2>\nIn 2006, we decided to build a robot that could do everything-play defense, and score in the upper and lower goals in that year''s game, "Aim High." Though we thought we may have over-extended ourselves, everyone was supportive and helped make last-minute changes at competition. After our final seeding match we were ranked 34th, but teams 177 (Bobcat Robotics of South Windsor) and 176 (Aces High from Suffield and Windsor Locks High Schools) had faith in our team and chose us to be their alliance partner. With a lot of team work and a little luck, the UberBots and our alliance partners battled our way to the top to win the UTC New England regional.\n<br>\n<br>\nOur regional win that year qualified us for the 2006 national competition in Atlanta, and the long haul from Connecticut was definitely worth it. The memories created there will be with the team forever. The UberBots also competed in Battlecry @ WPI in June, and Bash @ the Beach in October, an offseason event that we participate in to this day. The Bash @ the Beach was a great competition for our team because it allowed us to work in a competitive yet low-key environment with the new year''s team, as it takes place in October. We allied with teams 190 (Gompei Herd of Worchester, MA) and 500 (Waterford''s Team USA) and placed second. We also received an "All Business" award commending "the team that is most serious about their robotics and their fun."\n<br>\n<h2 style="color:#bf0000; font-weight:bold">2007: Time to Rack ''n'' Roll</h2>\nRiding our success in 2006, we decided to build another multi-functional robot for the 2007 competition, "Rank ''n'' Roll." Our robot, which we named "Dynamite" included a 2-joint arm (with a "wrist" and "shoulder" motor and a gripper for a hand) which gave us great flexibility since we could both score by putting tubes on the rack and get points back by removing "spoiler" game pieces. Dynamite also had a set of deployable ramps long enough to hold two robots, which earned us bonus points. Dynamite also had heft bumpers that allowed us to play defense if we needed to, and an autonomous mode with 16 different functions that allowed us to automatically raise Dynamite''s arm to different heights and other useful things.\n<br>\n<br>\nWe were able to "Rack ''n'' Roll" our way to the top, finishing as an alliance captain (in the top 8), and we ultimately won the UTC Connecticut Regional with team 195 (the CyberKnights of Southington) and team 558 (the RoboSquad from New Haven). For the second year in a row, we traveled to Atlanta to compete in the nationals, ending up in the Newton division again. This time, however, we were ranked third after the division seeding matches, and allied with  teams 1592 (the Bionic Tigers from Cocoa, FL) and 1816 (The Green Machine, all the way from Edina, Minnesota!). Our powerful alliance brought us all the way to the division finals. The UberBots continued to Einstein as the backup bot for Newton''s champion. After the Championship, we competed at Battlecry @ WPI, hosted by team 190, where we seeded 1st for the first time ever.\n<br>\n'),

I wanted to take some time and record some general knowledge within a management team; along with some areas to remember as a new management team.\n\nWhen you are a brand new member to the management team it is difficult to understand what needs to be done and any deadlines you need to abide by. Hopefully this "post" will help future management teams get off the ground running!\n\n[b]Mass Emails:[/b]\nIf your team doesn''t know when an event is happening, how could any members possibly show up? Questions like this are exactly why the UberBots mass email system exists. When an event is about a month away, send a mass email letting parents and team members know what is going on. To learn more about our procedures for mass emails, along with other processes please [url=http://uberbots.org/o/Resources/For_FIRST_Teams/General_Procedures]click here.[/url]\n\n\n[b]Events: [/b]\nWhen planning for an event, their are a few key items to remember:\nMentors: You can''t have an event or a meeting without one.\nAttendance roster: Ask who can attend each event and at what times, otherwise you may be alone at an event (no fun)...\n\n[b]Competitions:[/b]\nBash at the Beach: Usually the beginning to mid October, make sure you get a gift basket ready prior to the competition. Use donated items or purchase items that coordinate with a theme. Around $75\nDon''t just focus on the drive team!! The rest of the team is just as crucial! (ie: scouting and spirit)\n\n[b]Management Emails:[/b]\nThese are critical to your success. If you can outline what event / fundraiser / meeting agenda''s in chronological order it makes it much easier to prepare and execute your "plan". Also, after each event send a summary email, and outline what the plan for the next week -> month will look like. \n\nHere is an example of inter management emails from right after Avon Day 2010:\n\n[size=85]"Hey guys,\n\nAvon day was a huge success. All throughout morning we had many interested parents whose younger children were very interested in the program.\nWe visited every booth and dropped off a brochure and a spoke about our program. In addition to the brochure we drove the 2008 robot past all of the booths using the inverter, which attracted quite a few people to our booth. \nWe presented on stage from 3-3:30 with a captive audience, Lauren, Justin, Matt H, and I spoke about FIRST, preseason, build season, awards, and how people can support our team.\nAs for team members in attendance we had 7 or 8 that stayed all day and a few who stopped by either in the morning or in the afternoon.\n\nMoving to our To Do list for this week... Here are a few keys things we need to focus on:\n1. Management members attending the school activities fair TOMORROW during all four lunches.\n2.Entrance basket for B@B, what to include, where to get it from.\n3. Driver selection for B@B, hopefully Thursday night we can have a Driver Tryout and select 2 or 3 teams of drivers for the event.\n4. Double check with Mr. Sunblade about our transportation situation\n5. Fundraisers and the trip along Route 44 for donations, this needs to be arranged asap. (I have compiled an Assets/Liabilities spreadsheet for usto discuss at some point...)\n6. Registering for the regional (Opens September 30th, and i don''t think we [the students] can do that)\n\nJust as a side note, Ameya, can you either post the minutes for Avon Day or use a derivation of the notes above?\n\nThanks,\n\nName Here"[/size]\n\n[b]What weâ€™ve learned[/b]\n\n-Recruitment should be a high priority and should be focused on towards the end of the year and over the summer.\n-Visit the middle school during the day sometime in the spring\n-Talk to the incoming freshmen class at step-up day and orientation\n-Make personal connections with interested freshmen.\n-Include freshmen especially during first few meetings in interesting activity, with long speeches.\n-Be interesting and fun\n-Create a nice balance between fundraisers and robodemos.\n         -space them out throughout the pre-season and plan them out\n-Donâ€™t wait until the last minute to plan stuff\n-Make a to-do list for the week ahead and follow up on it\n         -Delegate jobs and assign responsibilities\n-Make management in-person meetings over the summer and establish weekly teleconferences\n-Find a place to print brochures and do it ahead of time\n-Make sure you have a practice space\n-Decide which awards the team wants to go for and donâ€™t save them all for build season\n-Do stuff for the community (pay it forward)\n-Update all team necessities well before build season\n         -ie: safety stuff\n         -cleanup day\n         -Handbook\n         -Tri-Fold\n\n'),

Questions like this are exactly why the UberBots mass email system exists. When an event is about a month away, send a mass email letting parents and team members know what is going on. To learn more about our procedures for mass emails, along with other processes please [url=http://uberbots.org/o/Resources/For_FIRST_Teams/General_Procedures]click here.[/url]\n\n\n[h2]Events: [/h2]\nWhen planning for an event, their are a few key items to remember:\nMentors: You can''t have an event or a meeting without one.\nAttendance roster: Ask who can attend each event and at what times, otherwise you may be alone at an event (no fun)...\n\n[h2]Competitions:[/h2]\nBash at the Beach: Usually the beginning to mid October, make sure you get a gift basket ready prior to the competition. Use donated items or purchase items that coordinate with a theme. Around $75\nDon''t just focus on the drive team!! The rest of the team is just as crucial! (ie: scouting and spirit)\n\n[h2]Management Emails:[/h2]\nThese are critical to your success. If you can outline what event / fundraiser / meeting agenda''s in chronological order it makes it much easier to prepare and execute your "plan". Also, after each event send a summary email, and outline what the plan for the next week -> month will look like. \n\nHere is an example of inter management emails from right after Avon Day 2010:\n\n[size=85]"Hey guys,\n\nAvon day was a huge success. All throughout morning we had many interested parents whose younger children were very interested in the program.\nWe visited every booth and dropped off a brochure and a spoke about our program. In addition to the brochure we drove the 2008 robot past all of the booths using the inverter, which attracted quite a few people to our booth. \nWe presented on stage from 3-3:30 with a captive audience, Lauren, Justin, Matt H, and I spoke about FIRST, preseason, build season, awards, and how people can support our team.\nAs for team members in attendance we had 7 or 8 that stayed all day and a few who stopped by either in the morning or in the afternoon.\n\nMoving to our To Do list for this week... Here are a few keys things we need to focus on:\n1. Management members attending the school activities fair TOMORROW during all four lunches.\n2.Entrance basket for B@B, what to include, where to get it from.\n3. Driver selection for B@B, hopefully Thursday night we can have a Driver Tryout and select 2 or 3 teams of drivers for the event.\n4. Double check with Mr. Sunblade about our transportation situation\n5. Fundraisers and the trip along Route 44 for donations, this needs to be arranged asap. (I have compiled an Assets/Liabilities spreadsheet for usto discuss at some point...)\n6. Registering for the regional (Opens September 30th, and i don''t think we [the students] can do that)\n\nJust as a side note, Ameya, can you either post the minutes for Avon Day or use a derivation of the notes above?\n\nThanks,\n\nName Here"[/size]\n\n[h2]What weâ€™ve learned[/h2]\n\n-Recruitment should be a high priority and should be focused on towards the end of the year and over the summer.\n-Visit the middle school during the day sometime in the spring\n-Talk to the incoming freshmen class at step-up day and orientation\n-Make personal connections with interested freshmen.\n-Include freshmen especially during first few meetings in interesting activity, with long speeches.\n-Be interesting and fun\n-Create a nice balance between fundraisers and robodemos.\n         -space them out throughout the pre-season and plan them out\n-Donâ€™t wait until the last minute to plan stuff\n-Make a to-do list for the week ahead and follow up on it\n         -Delegate jobs and assign responsibilities\n-Make management in-person meetings over the summer and establish weekly teleconferences\n-Find a place to print brochures and do it ahead of time\n-Make sure you have a practice space\n-Decide which awards the team wants to go for and donâ€™t save them all for build season\n-Do stuff for the community (pay it forward)\n-Update all team necessities well before build season\n         -ie: safety stuff\n         -cleanup day\n         -Handbook\n         -Tri-Fold\n\n[h2]Money Handling[/h2]\nSteps to follow after a successful fundraiser:\n1. Two members of management must count money raised at every event. (Treasurer and President)\n2. Record amount raised in ledger\n3. Place funds in a sealed envelope. (Include Date, total money enclosed, and a description of funds)\n4. Signature of treasurer on envelope\n5. Give envelope to Mrs. Muller the next business day\n\n[b]Other Tips[/b]\n-Make sure you double count every fundraisers donations, having an accurate number is critical!\n-Record all transactions in the ledger immediately after an event, otherwise you may forget which event the money came from.\n-NEVER leave money in the cash box! (unless it is pizza Money!)\n\n\n\nHope this helped!!\n'),
(153, 'code', '<h1>About Our Team</h1>\n<h2 style="color:#bf0000; font-weight:bold">2002-2003: Year One</h2>\nIn 2002, a group of students at Avon High School started a FIRST robotics team called "The Cheetahs," as our main sponsor then was Cheetah Learning. \n<br>\n<br>\nWe competed in our first competition in 2003, "Stack Attack," and we ranked 9th and were eliminated in the quarter finals. We also won the Rookie All-Star award. Things were starting out great!\n<br>\n<h2 style="color:#bf0000; font-weight:bold">2004: The ÃœberBots!</h2>\nThough our name was different, we were UberBots at heart, and we changed our name to the UberBots in the fall of 2004. We participated in the 2004 competition, "Raising the Bar," where we were ranked 27th and didn''t make it into elimination. However, we competed at Bash at the Beach that year, an off-season competition hosted by the Techno Ticks, and were on the winning alliance.\n<br>\n<h2 style="color:#bf0000; font-weight:bold">2005: Triple Play</h2>\nIn 2005 we competed in the game "Triple Play" and were ranked 10th, eliminated in the quarter finals.\n<br>\n<h2 style="color:#bf0000; font-weight:bold">2006: Off to Atlanta</h2>\nIn 2006, we decided to build a robot that could do everything-play defense, and score in the upper and lower goals in that year''s game, "Aim High." Though we thought we may have over-extended ourselves, everyone was supportive and helped make last-minute changes at competition. After our final seeding match we were ranked 34th, but teams 177 (Bobcat Robotics of South Windsor) and 176 (Aces High from Suffield and Windsor Locks High Schools) had faith in our team and chose us to be their alliance partner. With a lot of team work and a little luck, the UberBots and our alliance partners battled our way to the top to win the UTC New England regional.\n<br>\n<br>\nOur regional win that year qualified us for the 2006 national competition in Atlanta, and the long haul from Connecticut was definitely worth it. The memories created there will be with the team forever. The UberBots also competed in Battlecry @ WPI in June, and Bash @ the Beach in October, an offseason event that we participate in to this day. The Bash @ the Beach was a great competition for our team because it allowed us to work in a competitive yet low-key environment with the new year''s team, as it takes place in October. We allied with teams 190 (Gompei Herd of Worchester, MA) and 500 (Waterford''s Team USA) and placed second. We also received an "All Business" award commending "the team that is most serious about their robotics and their fun."\n<br>\n<h2 style="color:#bf0000; font-weight:bold">2007: Time to Rack ''n'' Roll</h2>\nRiding our success in 2006, we decided to build another multi-functional robot for the 2007 competition, "Rank ''n'' Roll." Our robot, which we named "Dynamite" included a 2-joint arm (with a "wrist" and "shoulder" motor and a gripper for a hand) which gave us great flexibility since we could both score by putting tubes on the rack and get points back by removing "spoiler" game pieces. Dynamite also had a set of deployable ramps long enough to hold two robots, which earned us bonus points. Dynamite also had heft bumpers that allowed us to play defense if we needed to, and an autonomous mode with 16 different functions that allowed us to automatically raise Dynamite''s arm to different heights and other useful things.\n<br>\n<br>\nWe were able to "Rack ''n'' Roll" our way to the top, finishing as an alliance captain (in the top 8), and we ultimately won the UTC Connecticut Regional with team 195 (the CyberKnights of Southington) and team 558 (the RoboSquad from New Haven). For the second year in a row, we traveled to Atlanta to compete in the nationals, ending up in the Newton division again. This time, however, we were ranked third after the division seeding matches, and allied with  teams 1592 (the Bionic Tigers from Cocoa, FL) and 1816 (The Green Machine, all the way from Edina, Minnesota!). Our powerful alliance brought us all the way to the division finals. The UberBots continued to Einstein as the backup bot for Newton''s champion. After the Championship, we competed at Battlecry @ WPI, hosted by team 190, where we seeded 1st for the first time ever.\n<br>\n'),

With the OmniPage skin system, changing how the site looks is simply a matter of editing a skin file. Skin files are HTML, CSS, and Javascript files that manage how the site appears to the user. These files are passed dynamic content through the module files via special functions. This content is then displayed in the skin and shown to the end user. Now, when the website team would like to change how the site looks, they simply have to create a new skin with all the necessary files, instead of recoding the site. Skins can also be used to provide a dynamic viewing experience. A special skin can be used to simply shake things up or to make the site mobile device friendly. Either way, the ability to have skins is an important feature of the OmniPage system.<br/><a href="#top">Top of Page</a></p>\n\n<a name=''communication''><h2>Communication</h2></a>\n<p><a href="http://facebook.com/TheUberBots"><img src="http://uberbots.org/omni/media/facebook.png" style="float:right;padding-left:5px;"/></a>\nThe OmniPage system also integrates communication with team members into its architecture. There is native support for emailing all team members, as well as other groups of users (as determined through the forums). The website also supports sending out mass SMS messages to those who signed up. The website will automatically send out a mass SMS 24 hours before any event on the calendar, ensuring team members are informed about upcoming events. These features come in handy for alerting team members to news regarding the team.<br/>\nThe OmniCore is also integrated with social networking. The UberBots <a href=''http://twitter.com/team1124''>Twitter</a> Account and <a href="http://facebook.com/TheUberBots">Facebook</a> fanpage are linked to the website, making is easy to update both.<br/><a href="http://twitter.com/team1124"><img src="http://uberbots.org/omni/media/twitter.png" /></a><br/><a href="#top">Top of Page</a></p>\n\n<h2 id="security">Security</h2>\n<p>The OmniPage also has native security features. All user accounts are integrated with the UberBots phpBB <a href="http://uberbots.org/forums">forums</a>. Having this integration removes the hassle of team members having multiple accounts (for both main site and forums), a problem encountered in previous websites. The usage of forums accounts created an "all in one" user account that works for the entire UberBots website. <br/>Using the forums accounts also provides simple security features. PhpBB has native usergroups, which the OmniCore uses to decide whether a user can see or edit a certain page. Some groups have global permissions while others can only deal with certain pages. Administrators also have the ability to give certain users or groups special permissions (that aren''t native) for certain pages. This helps with maintaining website content; now any user can be responsible for a certain page and make sure it''s up to date. This system also ensures security with regard to editing content.<br/>\nThe OmniPage system also has native log features. When an administrative action is carried out, the system will automatically append an entry to a log text file with important information regarding the edit. Username, time, and the action are recorded. This record of events helps ensure security with administrative features.<br/><a href="#top">Top of Page</a></p>\n');

The first 15 seconds of the game are known as the "hybrid" period, and it works as a combination of autonomous robot functions and driver-operated functions.  The "RoboCoach" has an infra-red remote with four commands which can direct the robot to the next step of the autonomous code after it has completed a task.  The second period in the game, the final 2 minutes, is known as the teleoperated period.  Two robot "Drivers" control the robot using joysticks, under the direction of a "Coach".<br />Â Â Â Â \n<br />Â Â Â Â \nOverdrive is played using two alliances, a red and a blue alliance, each made of three randomly selected teams from the competition.  Each alliance has two game pieces, 40" diameter "trackballs", in either red or blue to match the alliance color.  The goal is to drive around the track-like field, using the trackballs to score points.  The trackballs begin the match on top of a 6.5'' bridge-like structure known as the "overpass".  In order to play with the trackballs, they must first be removed from the overpass- this action scores 12 points in hybrid period.  There are two ways to score points with the trackball- by the trackball "crossing" the finish line- the line located directly beneath the overpass- or by the trackball "hurdling" the overpass (traveling over it).  At the end of a match, any trackballs on top of the overpass score bonus points.  Robots can also score points by crossing finish lines, or the lane markers between the left and right halves of the field.  Robots may only travel in a counter-clockwise direction, and may not break the plane of one of the finish lines or lane markers which divides the field into quadrants.<br />Â Â Â Â Â \n<br />Â Â Â Â \nAbout our Robot/Competitions:<br />Â Â Â Â \n<br />Â Â Â Â \nSo far, Overdrive is turning out to be a really fun and exciting game!  We''ve been practicing on the practice field we built in Reflexite''s warehouse, and we attended the Suffield Shakedown 2008 Scrimmage hosted by Team 176, Aces High.  The event was exhilirating, and we got the chance to see what we''ll be up against at the Connecticut Regional.  There were so many great robots there.  We were lucky enough to be chosen by team 230 (the Gaelhawks) to join them on the second-seed alliance, along with team 1784 (the Litchbots).  This is the second year in a row we''ve worked with team 230 at the scrimmage, and it worked out really well for us.  Our three robots worked brilliantly together, carrying us through the elimination matches without any losses.  Our alliance won the scrimmage, which was fantastic!  We''re really glad that we got the honor of working with teams 230 and 1784.  Besides our robots on the field, our team members bonded and helped each other to get through the long day.  In the stands, spirited members team up and cheered their hearts out.  In fact, the ÃœberBots even won the spirit award!  We were working towards the spirit award at the Connecticut Regional, so it was nice to be recognized for outstanding spirit (for the first time <em>ever</em>!) at the scrimmage.<br />Â Â Â Â \n<br />Â Â Â Â \nWe also attended the Connecticut Regional.  During Friday''s award ceremony, we were honored with the Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers Entrepreneurship Award, to recognize our work in the community.  Over the course of the qualification matches, our robot performed consistently well, working with many diverse types of robots and different teams.  We won all of the eight qualification matches we played, seeding first of the 62 teams at the competition.  This was an incredible accomplishment for a team that, just two years ago, had to fix broken robot parts after every match.  There was an immense amount of cooperation and patience among our team members and sub-teams, which is what ultimately allowed us to do so well as a team.  We partnered with team 175 (Buzz Robotics) and team 716 (the Who''s-C-Teks) to form the first seed alliance for the elimination matches.  Our alliance continued undefeated through the quarter-finals, the semi-finals, and the finals, winning the Connecticut Regional.  It was unbelievable and exhilirating to realize that the ÃœberBots had gone undefeated for three days, and won the Connecticut Regional for the third consecutive year.<br />Â Â Â Â \n<br />Â Â Â Â \nThe team also was quite successful at the Championship Event in Atlanta.  Down on the field, the competition got fierce, but the students were efficient and calm, holding everyone together and preventing any disasters on the field. After two days of elimination matches, the ÃœberBots finished with a 6-1 record, becoming the captains of the third alliance. They invited teams 1024 and 177 to join their alliance, creating an extremely well-rounded alliance which could handle just about anything. The alliance continued to win the quarterfinals, advancing to the semifinals, then the semifinals, advancing to the finals, where they faced the number four seed alliance, captained by team 987. The finals were very intense- our alliance had a team with three regional wins this season (1024) and one of last year''s world champions (177), and the opposing alliance had another one of last year''s world champions (987) along with last year''s national Chairman''s Award winner (365). Our alliance won the first match but lost the second, bringing the finals to a third match. We pulled it off, becoming the winner on the Archimedes field, and the representatives for our field on Einstein. This was the equivalent of making it to the final four in the world, except for robotics instead of basketball. The alliance continued to play on the Einstein field, facing tough defense and mechanical failures, but putting up our best. We became national semifinalists.<br /> \n'),

(181, 'code', '[h1]About Our Website[/h1]\nAt the beginning of 2010, the UberBots decided they needed to design a new website. When considering why the old one had not worked as well as they wanted, they determined that if the website''s code and content were interlaced, the site would be impossible for a non-programmer to maintain and would be harder to add code onto. Also, the process of creating individual pages was too difficult. How then, could code be separated from content and pages be creating with a single click. At that point, the UberBots website team conceptualized what they coined "OmniPage" system. It would function as a content management system with complete modularity. Six months later, the new UberBots website was ready to hit the web!\n\nThe OmniPage system, run by the OmniCore, can be summed up it the following diagram:\n[ubimg]/omni/media/omnicore.png[/ubimg]\nFor the presentation the website team gave the the rest of the UberBots regarding the OmniPage system, go [url=http://uberbots.org/omni/media/files/Old%20Website%20Files/Website%20Proposal.ppt]here[/url] (.ppt).\n\nMore Information:\n[list]\n[*][url=http://uberbots.org/o/about/our_website/focuses]Website Focuses[/url]\n[*][url=http://uberbots.org/o/about/our_website/behind_the_scenes]Behind the Scenes[/url]\n[*][url=http://uberbots.org/o/about/our_website/advantages]Advantages of the OmniPage System[/url]\n[*][url=http://uberbots.org/documentation]Website Documentation[/url]\n[/list]'),

After build season, we compete in the Connecticut Regional (and The WPI Regional in 2010 actually) and the international championship in Atlanta, GA (but in 2011, it''s going to be in St. Louis, MO).

Most importantly, we would like to thank UTC Fire and Security who helps more than anybody to make our team possible.

However, we competed at Bash at the Beach that year, an off-season competition hosted by the Techno Ticks, and were on the winning alliance.\n<br>\n<h2 style="color:#bf0000; font-weight:bold">2005: Triple Play</h2>\nIn 2005 we competed in the game "Triple Play" and were ranked 10th, eliminated in the quarter finals.\n<br>\n<h2 style="color:#bf0000; font-weight:bold">2006: Off to Atlanta</h2>\nIn 2006, we decided to build a robot that could do everything-play defense, and score in the upper and lower goals in that year''s game, "Aim High." Though we thought we may have over-extended ourselves, everyone was supportive and helped make last-minute changes at competition. After our final seeding match we were ranked 34th, but teams 177 (Bobcat Robotics of South Windsor) and 176 (Aces High from Suffield and Windsor Locks High Schools) had faith in our team and chose us to be their alliance partner. With a lot of team work and a little luck, the UberBots and our alliance partners battled our way to the top to win the UTC New England regional.\n<br>\n<br>\nOur regional win that year qualified us for the 2006 national competition in Atlanta, and the long haul from Connecticut was definitely worth it. The memories created there will be with the team forever. The UberBots also competed in Battlecry @ WPI in June, and Bash @ the Beach in October, an offseason event that we participate in to this day. The Bash @ the Beach was a great competition for our team because it allowed us to work in a competitive yet low-key environment with the new year''s team, as it takes place in October. We allied with teams 190 (Gompei Herd of Worchester, MA) and 500 (Waterford''s Team USA) and placed second. We also received an "All Business" award commending "the team that is most serious about their robotics and their fun."\n<br>\n<h2 style="color:#bf0000; font-weight:bold">2007: Time to Rack ''n'' Roll</h2>\nRiding our success in 2006, we decided to build another multi-functional robot for the 2007 competition, "Rank ''n'' Roll." Our robot, which we named "Dynamite" included a 2-joint arm (with a "wrist" and "shoulder" motor and a gripper for a hand) which gave us great flexibility since we could both score by putting tubes on the rack and get points back by removing "spoiler" game pieces. Dynamite also had a set of deployable ramps long enough to hold two robots, which earned us bonus points. Dynamite also had heft bumpers that allowed us to play defense if we needed to, and an autonomous mode with 16 different functions that allowed us to automatically raise Dynamite''s arm to different heights and other useful things.\n<br>\n<br>\nWe were able to "Rack ''n'' Roll" our way to the top, finishing as an alliance captain (in the top 8), and we ultimately won the UTC Connecticut Regional with team 195 (the CyberKnights of Southington) and team 558 (the RoboSquad from New Haven). For the second year in a row, we traveled to Atlanta to compete in the nationals, ending up in the Newton division again. This time, however, we were ranked third after the division seeding matches, and allied with  teams 1592 (the Bionic Tigers from Cocoa, FL) and 1816 (The Green Machine, all the way from Edina, Minnesota!). Our powerful alliance brought us all the way to the division finals. The UberBots continued to Einstein as the backup bot for Newton''s champion. After the Championship, we competed at Battlecry @ WPI, hosted by team 190, where we seeded 1st for the first time ever.\n<br>\n'),
(206, 'code', '<h2 style="color:#bf0000; font-weight:bold">2008: Shifting into OverDrive</h2>\nThe game in 2008 was Overdrive, a fast-paced game where teams could score points either by carrying one of two game pieces per alliance, 40" diameter track balls, around the the field, or simply by making laps. Teams could also earn points by "hurdling" the track balls over the 9-foot "overpass" in the middle of the field. The field was divided the long way down the center to give it a race-track feel. We responded to these aspects of the game in many ways as we designed and built our robot that year, Lightning.\n<br>\n<br>\nWe gave Lightning a two-speed transmission so that we could have both the speed to make it around the track and the precision to pick up the large track balls. To pick up and handle the large balls, we gave Lightning a 2-joint arm and a claw that could expand to wrap around the ball, then contract to keep possession of the ball as we moved around the field.\n<br>\n<br>\nWe built a second robot and a replica of the field in the space donated to us by Reflexite so that we could practice driving even after we had shipped our robot off after build season. We attended the Suffield Shakedown 2008 Scrimmage hosted by Team 176, Aces High. The competition was good practice for the new 2008 season''s team, and it let us see how other teams had tackled the challenges of the game. Allied with team 230 (the Gaelhawks) and team 1784 (the Litchbots), we won the scrimmage undefeated. Our team was also successful off the field, winning the spirit award for the first time ever. We were looking forward to how we would fare at the Connecticut regional.\n<br>\n<br>\nAt the Connecticut Regional, we won all our qualification matches, allied with numerous other great teams, and placed first in seeding among the 62 teams at the competition. This was a mark of progress for our team, as only two years ago we had had to fix our robot after every match. For the elimination matches, we allied with team 175 (Buzz Robotics) and team 716 (the Who''s-C-Teks). Through the quarterfinals, semifinals, and finals, our alliance went undefeated, winning the Connecticut Regional. During the award ceremony, we were honored with the Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers Entrepreneurship Award, recognizing our work in the community.\n<br>\n<br>\nIn 2008, the ÃœberBots also competed in the Championship in Atlanta. In qualification, we achieved a 6-1 record, becoming the captains of the third alliance. We invited teams 1024 and 177 to be part of our alliance, creating a well-rounded team that could handle any situation on the field. Our alliance won in the quarterfinals and the semifinals, leading us to the finals where we faced another strong alliance captained by team 987. With past world champions and multiple regional winners on both sides, the competition was intense, but our alliance pulled through to become the champions of the Archimedes field. We advanced to the Einstein field, where we played teams who had advanced from other divisions. Our alliance faced even tougher competition there, but we became international semifinalists. 2008 was a great year for the ÃœberBots. We went undefeated in all our regionals, and advanced all the way to the world semifinals in Atlanta.'),
(207, 'code', '<h2 style="color:#bf0000; font-weight:bold">2009: Absolute Lunacy</h2>\nAbout the Game:\n     \n     This year''s game, FIRST Lunacy, is 2 minutes and 15 seconds long, and has two main sections of game play. The first 15 seconds of the game are known as the autonomous period, in which the robot has to run without driver assistance and solely on pre-installed programming. The second period in the game, the final 2 minutes, is known as the teleoperated period. Two robot "Pilots" control the robot using joysticks, under the direction of a "Commander". Also during the game, various "Payload Specialists" have the ability to score on the sides of the field at "payload stations"- one and each long side and each corner.\n     \n     Lunacy is played using two alliances: red versus blue. The alliances are randomly selected for the majority of matches. The game itself is held on a field called a "Crater," which is 27x54 feet and covered with a slippery material known as "Regolith." The field material, combined with the FIRST required wheels, simulates the reduced traction experienced when on the moon. The main objective is to score as many points as possible by getting game pieces into the trailers of opposing robots. Trailers are attached to the back of every robot. The main game pieces in Lunacy are known as "moon rocks." There are 120 moon rocks on the field for teams to play with. Robots are allowed start with seven in their possession, and the others are spread out among the various Payload Specialists. Once the game starts, robots and Payload Specialists alike can attempt to throw moon rocks into trailers. There are also four "empty cells" per alliance, located at the long side payload stations. Payload Specialists can give these empty cells to the robots, who can then transfer them to the corner stations. In the last 20 seconds of the game, any empty cells that made it to the corner Payload Stations can be exchanged for "super cells," which are worth more points if correctly scored.\n\nAbout our Robot/Competitions:\n     \n     The 2009 game, Lunacy, brought new challenges for us. The field surface was very different and required all new thought processes for driving and traction control. Although the build season was tough, we managed to pull through at the end and win Suffield Shakedown with the help of Teams 195 and 126. Thanks again to Ace''s High 176 for hosting such an awesome event.\n     \n     After Suffield, we competed in the Connecticut Regional. Although we were not as successful as past years, we still won the Rockwell Automation Innovation in Control Award, which celebrated our complex code for traction control, autonomous, and much more. It was a great experience and we learned a lot for the event that followed only a few weeks after...\n     \n     The International Competition in Atlanta, Georgia was incredible. Not only was it a lot of fun, but our team managed to pull through and even make it to the quarter finals on Galileo Field. It was intense competition, playing against the alliance that went on to win the entire event! All in all it was a fantastic year.\n<h2 style="color:#bf0000; font-weight:bold">2010: A real BreakAway</h2>\nComing Soon...\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nFor more information about our team''s past seasons and our alumni, please visit our Alumni Website at <a href="http://alumni.uberbots.org" target="blank">http://alumni.uberbots.org</a>.'),

We also won the Rookie All-Star award. Things were starting out great!\n<br>\n<h2 style="color:#bf0000; font-weight:bold">2003-4: The ÃœberBots!</h2>\nThough our name was different, we were UberBots at heart, and we changed our name to the UberBots in the fall of 2004. We participated in the 2004 competition, "Raising the Bar," where we were ranked 27th and didn''t make it into elimination. However, we competed at Bash at the Beach that year, an off-season competition hosted by the Techno Ticks, and were on the winning alliance.\n<br>\n<h2 style="color:#bf0000; font-weight:bold">2004-5: Triple Play</h2>\nIn 2005 we competed in the game "Triple Play" and were ranked 10th, eliminated in the quarter finals.\n<br>\n<h2 style="color:#bf0000; font-weight:bold">2005-6: Off to Atlanta</h2>\nIn 2006, we decided to build a robot that could do everything-play defense, and score in the upper and lower goals in that year''s game, "Aim High." Though we thought we may have over-extended ourselves, everyone was supportive and helped make last-minute changes at competition. After our final seeding match we were ranked 34th, but teams 177 (Bobcat Robotics of South Windsor) and 176 (Aces High from Suffield and Windsor Locks High Schools) had faith in our team and chose us to be their alliance partner. With a lot of team work and a little luck, the UberBots and our alliance partners battled our way to the top to win the UTC New England regional.\n<br>\n<br>\nOur regional win that year qualified us for the 2006 national competition in Atlanta, and the long haul from Connecticut was definitely worth it. The memories created there will be with the team forever. The UberBots also competed in Battlecry @ WPI in June, and Bash @ the Beach in October, an offseason event that we participate in to this day. The Bash @ the Beach was a great competition for our team because it allowed us to work in a competitive yet low-key environment with the new year''s team, as it takes place in October. We allied with teams 190 (Gompei Herd of Worchester, MA) and 500 (Waterford''s Team USA) and placed second. We also received an "All Business" award commending "the team that is most serious about their robotics and their fun."\n<br>\n<h2 style="color:#bf0000; font-weight:bold">2006-7: Time to Rack ''n'' Roll</h2>\nRiding our success in 2006, we decided to build another multi-functional robot for the 2007 competition, "Rank ''n'' Roll." Our robot, which we named "Dynamite" included a 2-joint arm (with a "wrist" and "shoulder" motor and a gripper for a hand) which gave us great flexibility since we could both score by putting tubes on the rack and get points back by removing "spoiler" game pieces. Dynamite also had a set of deployable ramps long enough to hold two robots, which earned us bonus points.

For the second year in a row, we traveled to Atlanta to compete in the nationals, ending up in the Newton division again. This time, however, we were ranked third after the division seeding matches, and allied with  teams 1592 (the Bionic Tigers from Cocoa, FL) and 1816 (The Green Machine, all the way from Edina, Minnesota!). Our powerful alliance brought us all the way to the division finals. The UberBots continued to Einstein as the backup bot for Newton''s champion.

(214, 'code', '<h2 style="color:#bf0000; font-weight:bold">2008-9: Absolute Lunacy</h2>\nAbout the Game:\n     \n     This year''s game, FIRST Lunacy, is 2 minutes and 15 seconds long, and has two main sections of game play. The first 15 seconds of the game are known as the autonomous period, in which the robot has to run without driver assistance and solely on pre-installed programming. The second period in the game, the final 2 minutes, is known as the teleoperated period. Two robot "Pilots" control the robot using joysticks, under the direction of a "Commander". Also during the game, various "Payload Specialists" have the ability to score on the sides of the field at "payload stations"- one and each long side and each corner.\n     \n     Lunacy is played using two alliances: red versus blue. The alliances are randomly selected for the majority of matches. The game itself is held on a field called a "Crater," which is 27x54 feet and covered with a slippery material known as "Regolith." The field material, combined with the FIRST required wheels, simulates the reduced traction experienced when on the moon. The main objective is to score as many points as possible by getting game pieces into the trailers of opposing robots. Trailers are attached to the back of every robot. The main game pieces in Lunacy are known as "moon rocks." There are 120 moon rocks on the field for teams to play with. Robots are allowed start with seven in their possession, and the others are spread out among the various Payload Specialists. Once the game starts, robots and Payload Specialists alike can attempt to throw moon rocks into trailers. There are also four "empty cells" per alliance, located at the long side payload stations. Payload Specialists can give these empty cells to the robots, who can then transfer them to the corner stations. In the last 20 seconds of the game, any empty cells that made it to the corner Payload Stations can be exchanged for "super cells," which are worth more points if correctly scored.\n\nAbout our Robot/Competitions:\n     \n     The 2009 game, Lunacy, brought new challenges for us. The field surface was very different and required all new thought processes for driving and traction control. Although the build season was tough, we managed to pull through at the end and win Suffield Shakedown with the help of Teams 195 and 126. Thanks again to Ace''s High 176 for hosting such an awesome event.\n     \n     After Suffield, we competed in the Connecticut Regional. Although we were not as successful as past years, we still won the Rockwell Automation Innovation in Control Award, which celebrated our complex code for traction control, autonomous, and much more. It was a great experience and we learned a lot for the event that followed only a few weeks after...\n     \n     The International Competition in Atlanta, Georgia was incredible. Not only was it a lot of fun, but our team managed to pull through and even make it to the quarter finals on Galileo Field. It was intense competition, playing against the alliance that went on to win the entire event! All in all it was a fantastic year.\n<h2 style="color:#bf0000; font-weight:bold">2010: A real BreakAway</h2>\nComing Soon...\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nFor more information about our team''s past seasons and our alumni, please visit our Alumni Website at <a href="http://alumni.uberbots.org" target="blank">http://alumni.uberbots.org</a>.'),

We also won the Rookie All-Star award. Things were starting out great!\n<br>\n<h2 style="color:#bf0000; font-weight:bold">2003-4: The ÃœberBots!</h2>\nThough our name was different, we were UberBots at heart, and we changed our name to the UberBots in the fall of 2004. We participated in the 2004 competition, "Raising the Bar," where we were ranked 27th and didn''t make it into elimination. However, we competed at Bash at the Beach that year, an off-season competition hosted by the Techno Ticks, and were on the winning alliance.\n<br>\n<h2 style="color:#bf0000; font-weight:bold">2004-5: Triple Play</h2>\nIn 2005 we competed in the game "Triple Play" and were ranked 10th, eliminated in the quarter finals.\n<br>\n<h2 style="color:#bf0000; font-weight:bold">2005-6: Off to Atlanta</h2>\nIn 2006, we decided to build a robot that could do everything-play defense, and score in the upper and lower goals in that year''s game, "Aim High." Though we thought we may have over-extended ourselves, everyone was supportive and helped make last-minute changes at competition. After our final seeding match we were ranked 34th, but teams 177 (Bobcat Robotics of South Windsor) and 176 (Aces High from Suffield and Windsor Locks High Schools) had faith in our team and chose us to be their alliance partner. With a lot of team work and a little luck, the UberBots and our alliance partners battled our way to the top to win the UTC New England regional.\n<br>\n<br>\nOur regional win that year qualified us for the 2006 national competition in Atlanta, and the long haul from Connecticut was definitely worth it. The memories created there will be with the team forever. The UberBots also competed in Battlecry @ WPI in June, and Bash @ the Beach in October, an offseason event that we participate in to this day. The Bash @ the Beach was a great competition for our team because it allowed us to work in a competitive yet low-key environment with the new year''s team, as it takes place in October. We allied with teams 190 (Gompei Herd of Worchester, MA) and 500 (Waterford''s Team USA) and placed second. We also received an "All Business" award commending "the team that is most serious about their robotics and their fun."\n<br>\n<h2 style="color:#bf0000; font-weight:bold">2006-7: Time to Rack ''n'' Roll</h2>\nRiding our success in 2006, we decided to build another multi-functional robot for the 2007 competition, "Rank ''n'' Roll." Our robot, which we named "Dynamite" included a 2-joint arm (with a "wrist" and "shoulder" motor and a gripper for a hand) which gave us great flexibility since we could both score by putting tubes on the rack and get points back by removing "spoiler" game pieces. Dynamite also had a set of deployable ramps long enough to hold two robots, which earned us bonus points. Dynamite also had heft bumpers that allowed us to play defense if we needed to, and an autonomous mode with 16 different functions that allowed us to automatically raise Dynamite''s arm to different heights and other useful things.\n<br>\n<br>\nWe were able to "Rack ''n'' Roll" our way to the top, finishing as an alliance captain (in the top 8), and we ultimately won the UTC Connecticut Regional with team 195 (the CyberKnights of Southington) and team 558 (the RoboSquad from New Haven). For the second year in a row, we traveled to Atlanta to compete in the nationals, ending up in the Newton division again. This time, however, we were ranked third after the division seeding matches, and allied with  teams 1592 (the Bionic Tigers from Cocoa, FL) and 1816 (The Green Machine, all the way from Edina, Minnesota!).

(220, 'code', '<h2 style="color:#bf0000; font-weight:bold">2007-8: Shifting into OverDrive</h2>\nThe game in 2008 was Overdrive, a fast-paced game where teams could score points either by carrying one of two game pieces per alliance, 40" diameter track balls, around the the field, or simply by making laps. Teams could also earn points by "hurdling" the track balls over the 9-foot "overpass" in the middle of the field. The field was divided the long way down the center to give it a race-track feel. We responded to these aspects of the game in many ways as we designed and built our robot that year, Lightning.\n<br>\n<br>\nWe gave Lightning a two-speed transmission so that we could have both the speed to make it around the track and the precision to pick up the large track balls. To pick up and handle the large balls, we gave Lightning a 2-joint arm and a claw that could expand to wrap around the ball, then contract to keep possession of the ball as we moved around the field.\n<br>\n<br>\nWe built a second robot and a replica of the field in the space donated to us by Reflexite so that we could practice driving even after we had shipped our robot off after build season. We attended the Suffield Shakedown 2008 Scrimmage hosted by Team 176, Aces High. The competition was good practice for the new 2008 season''s team, and it let us see how other teams had tackled the challenges of the game. Allied with team 230 (the Gaelhawks) and team 1784 (the Litchbots), we won the scrimmage undefeated. Our team was also successful off the field, winning the spirit award for the first time ever. We were looking forward to how we would fare at the Connecticut regional.\n<br>\n<br>\nAt the Connecticut Regional, we won all our qualification matches, allied with numerous other great teams, and placed first in seeding among the 62 teams at the competition. This was a mark of progress for our team, as only two years ago we had had to fix our robot after every match. For the elimination matches, we allied with team 175 (Buzz Robotics) and team 716 (the Who''s-C-Teks). Through the quarterfinals, semifinals, and finals, our alliance went undefeated, winning the Connecticut Regional. During the award ceremony, we were honored with the Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers Entrepreneurship Award, recognizing our work in the community.\n<br>\n<br>\nIn 2008, the ÃœberBots also competed in the Championship in Atlanta. In qualification, we achieved a 6-1 record, becoming the captains of the third alliance. We invited teams 1024 and 177 to be part of our alliance, creating a well-rounded team that could handle any situation on the field. Our alliance won in the quarterfinals and the semifinals, leading us to the finals where we faced another strong alliance captained by team 987. With past world champions and multiple regional winners on both sides, the competition was intense, but our alliance pulled through to become the champions of the Archimedes field. We advanced to the Einstein field, where we played teams who had advanced from other divisions. Our alliance faced even tougher competition there, but we became international semifinalists. 2008 was a great year for the ÃœberBots.

When considering why the old one had not worked as well as they wanted, they determined that if the website''s code and content were interlaced, the site would be impossible for a non-programmer to maintain and would be harder to add code onto. Also, the process of creating individual pages was too difficult. How then, could code be separated from content and pages be creating with a single click. At that point, the UberBots website team conceptualized what they coined "OmniPage" system. It would function as a content management system with complete modularity. Six months later, the new UberBots website was ready to hit the web!\n\nThe OmniPage system, run by the OmniCore, can be summed up it the following diagram:\n<img src="http://uberbots.org/omni/media/omnicore.png" />\nFor the presentation the website team gave the the rest of the UberBots regarding the OmniPage system, go <a href="http://uberbots.org/omni/media/files/Old%20Website%20Files/Website%20Proposal.ppt">here</a> (.ppt).\n\nMore Information:\n<ul>\n<li><a href="http://uberbots.org/o/about/our_website/focuses">Website Focuses</a></li>\n<li><a href="http://uberbots.org/o/about/our_website/behind_the_scenes">Behind the Scenes</a></li>\n<li><a href="http://uberbots.org/o/about/our_website/advantages">Advantages of the OmniPage System</a>\n<li><a href="http://uberbots.org/documentation">Website Documentation</a></li>\n</ul>'),

Then we have six weeks (know as build season) to plan, build, and program a robot for our team. After build season, we compete in the Connecticut Regional (and The WPI Regional in 2010) and the international championship in Atlanta, GA (but in 2011, it''s going to be in St. Louis, MO). Outside of this "season" between Kickoff and the Championship, we do dozens of community demos and fundraisers to build awareness about science, technology, and robotics.\n<p style="clear:both;">\n\n<h2 style="color:#002699">how we do it</h2>\n<img src="/omni/media/sponsors/utcfireandsecurity.png" style="float:left;padding-right:5px;">Building our robot as well as building our team requires mechanical, programming, engineering, business, marketing, and leadership skills, which our members learn and develop on the team thanks to experienced team members and our adult leaders and mentors. We would be nowhere without our sponsors and mentors. The knowledge and support of our mentors are what makes the program so fun and educational. Most importantly, we would like to thank UTC Fire and Security who helps more than anybody to make our team possible. For more information, please visit our <a href="about/our_mentors">Mentor</a> and <a href="about/our_sponsors">Sponsor</a> pages.\n<p style="clear:both;">\n\n<h2 style="color:#002699">why we do it</h2>\n<img src="http://www.uberbots.org/omni/media/firstlogo.gif" style="float:right;padding-left:5px;">\nWe spend all this time building a robot as well as our team to work to spread the ideals of FIRST around our community. We work to help make true FIRST''s vision: <i>"To transform our culture by creating a world where science and technology are celebrated."</i> In addition, we work <i>"to inspire young people to be science and technology leaders"</i> through exposure to science, technology, and gracious professionalism which we accomplish both within the team and outside it through our numerous community demos and fundraisers.

The process variable (PV) changes through each run-through of the PID Loop. The set point (SP) is the desired value of the process variable. The Loop calculates an error between the PV and SP and tries to minimize it. The PID Loop also includes three constant parameters: Proportional (P), Integral (I), and Derivative (D). <img src="/omni/media/pid_structure.png" style="padding:1px;"/> P is how severely the loop reacts to the error value. This is how much the robot compensates for the error value by changing the output. P uses multiplication to minimize the error. The I value determines the reaction of the loop based on the sum of recent errors. That is how much the reaction is changed. The reaction gets more severe if the robot takes longer to correct the error. I uses linear addition to minimize the error. The value for D determines the reaction to the error based on the rate of change in the error. This is the value which causes the PID to oscillate.\nThe P, I, and D outputs add together to create the output, which powers a mechanism (usually a motor) which in turn gives the PID feedRear through the PV.

(317, 'code', '<h3 id=''functions''>Functions</h3>\n<p>In many programming languages (especially object oriented ones), functions are an integral part of the coding. A function is a single block of code that can be called wherever it''s needed to perform its purpose (this is similar to the <a href="http://uberbots.org/o/about/our_website/advantages#modules">modules</a> of the <a href="http://www.uberbots.org/o/About/Our_Website">OmniPage System</a>). LabVIEW also has the ability to have function-like execution. In LabVIEW, simple make another VI and drag it from the project explorer into any other VI to call it.</p>\n<a href="#top">Top of Page</a>\n<br/><br/>\n<h2 id=''logic''>Programming Logic</h2>\n<p>Even though a programmer may know the syntax of a language flawlessly, that person may still have trouble writing effective code if he/she doesn''t have correct logic behind it. Knowing how to structure code effectively and efficiently creates much better code overall. Teaching logic is very hard to do, the best way to learn is by studying the language you will be using and then observing someone who knows how to use it well. Make sure to ask questions on now only how to do something, but also why something is being done.</p>\n<a href="#top">Top of Page</a>\n<br/><br/>\n<h2 id=''pid''>PID Control</h2>\n<p>The PID Loop takes in two main variables: the process variable and the set point. The process variable (PV) changes through each run-through of the PID Loop. The set point (SP) is the desired value of the process variable. The Loop calculates an error between the PV and SP and tries to minimize it. The PID Loop also includes three constant parameters: Proportional (P), Integral (I), and Derivative (D). <img src="/omni/media/pid_structure.png" style="padding:1px;"/> P is how severely the loop reacts to the error value. This is how much the robot compensates for the error value by changing the output. P uses multiplication to minimize the error. The I value determines the reaction of the loop based on the sum of recent errors. That is how much the reaction is changed. The reaction gets more severe if the robot takes longer to correct the error. I uses linear addition to minimize the error. The value for D determines the reaction to the error based on the rate of change in the error. This is the value which causes the PID to oscillate.\nThe P, I, and D outputs add together to create the output, which powers a mechanism (usually a motor) which in turn gives the PID feedRear through the PV. This process loops, creating a PID Loop.\n</p>\n<p>\n<a href="#top">Top of Page</a>\n<br/><br/>'),

If the conditional statement is true, then one set of code will be executed; otherwise, a different set of code will be executed. In traditional C code, an if statement looks like this:<br/>\n<code>\nif( conditional ){<br/>\nÂ Â Â statements if true<br/>\n}else{<br/>\nÂ Â Â statements if false<br/>\n}<br/>\n</code>\nThe <code>conditional</code> will evaluate to a boolean expression (either TRUE or FALSE). This will tell which section of code to execute. If the conditional is TRUE, then the statements within the first set of <code> { } </code> will be executed. If the conditional is FALSE, then the statements within the brackets of <code>else</code will be executed. \n</p>\n<p>\nIn LabVIEW, if statements are called case structures. A boolean value is wired to the input terminal, and there will be two cases: TRUE and FALSE.

This loop will execute as long as the value for <code>i</code> is less than 5. Once that statement is false, the loop will stop.

(359, 'code', '[h1]Team Structure[/h1]\nMaintaining a team requires a mixture of freedom and structure. Mentors and students comprise the active members that give the life and workforce to a team. The UberBots are run by a student-run Management Subteam. (One may notice I capitalized Management. This is because the word has gained such a proper-noun meaning within our team.)\n\nCurrently, the subteam is comprised of a President, Vice President, Secretary, Treasurer, and Community Liaison. The President is primarily the representative of the team when a singular presence is required and leads Management in its operations. The Vice President is second in command and presumes the President''s responsibilities when he or she isn''t available. In addition, the Vice President assists the other positions and fills in gaps in the team where needed. The secretary is in charge of taking meeting-minutes, attendance, keeping the calendar up to date, team communication, and collects forms and permission slips. The treasurer maintains the budget, deals with mentors to distribute funds, and collects and manages money. Our least self-explainitory position, however, is Community Liaison. He or she (along with the President) represent the team to the community and the outside world and leads the community team. He is responsible to schedule, plan, and lead fundraisers and demos as well as lead the community team and Chairman''s Team.\n\nThe Management Team is elected each year after the Championships (Atlanta/St. Louis). Members are nominated (or self nominated) for each position and from there we hold platforms and debates. Then each team member (including Seniors) casts one secret vote for each position, and one mentor tallies the ballots and announces the winners. Over the summer, the new Management works hard to prepare the team for the upcoming year. \n\nManagement works closely and meets regularly along with the team coach or mentors. They are generally responsible for making most decisions (except for regarding safety and money) and may be advised in their decisions by mentors. For example, if somebody on the team want to make a purchase, the treasurer is notified, who tells the management team, who decide whether or not to make a purchase, and if they decide to do so, go to the Coach for final approval.\n\nBelow Management, the team is divided into other subteams. Currently, we have a Systems Team, Mechanical Team, CAD Team, Website Team, and Community Team. The Systems Team programs and works with electronics. The Mechanical Team works on the physical and machinery aspects of the robot. The CAD Team models the robot on CAD programs and the Autodesk Award. The Website Team designs and maintains the website and prepares it for the Website Award. The Community Team works with the Community Liaison to plan demos and work on the Chairman''s Award. Students may pick to work with a specific subteam because of interests and skills, but are in no way restricted to staying with one subteam or stopped from taking part in a subteam.'),

(361, 'code', '[h1]New Members[/h1]\nThe Uberbots are always looking to attract new members to the team. Whether it be through a school function or at a public event, recruiting the next generation of UberBots is very important.\n\nOver the past few years we have used multiple strategies for recruitment. We use posters hung throughout our school along with morning P.A. announcements prior to important events. We also demonstrate our robot to our local Middle School and during "step up night" and "8th grade orientation." Along with posters and demonstrations we like to distribute our team Tri-Fold''s at every event to the parents of potential new team members of all ages!');

(362, 'code', '[h1]Management Team Tutorial / Information[/h1]\nHey guys,\nNow that the year has started and this years management team starts to get some pieces of the puzzle into place. I wanted to take some time and record some general knowledge within a management team; along with some areas to remember as a new management team.\n\nWhen you are a brand new member to the management team it is difficult to understand what needs to be done and any deadlines you need to abide by. Hopefully this "post" will help future management teams get off the ground running!\n\n[h2]Mass Emails:[/h2]\nIf your team doesn''t know when an event is happening, how could any members possibly show up? Questions like this are exactly why the UberBots mass email system exists. When an event is about a month away, send a mass email letting parents and team members know what is going on. To learn more about our procedures for mass emails, along with other processes please [url=http://uberbots.org/o/Resources/For_FIRST_Teams/General_Procedures]click here.[/url]\n\n\n[h2]Events: [/h2]\nWhen planning for an event, their are a few key items to remember:\nMentors: You can''t have an event or a meeting without one.\nAttendance roster: Ask who can attend each event and at what times, otherwise you may be alone at an event (no fun)...\n\n[h2]Competitions:[/h2]\nBash at the Beach: Usually the beginning to mid October, make sure you get a gift basket ready prior to the competition. Use donated items or purchase items that coordinate with a theme. Around $75\nDon''t just focus on the drive team!! The rest of the team is just as crucial! (ie: scouting and spirit)\n\n[h2]Management Emails:[/h2]\nThese are critical to your success. If you can outline what event / fundraiser / meeting agenda''s in chronological order it makes it much easier to prepare and execute your "plan". Also, after each event send a summary email, and outline what the plan for the next week -> month will look like. \n\nHere is an example of inter management emails from right after Avon Day 2010:\n\n[size=85]"Hey guys,\n\nAvon day was a huge success. All throughout morning we had many interested parents whose younger children were very interested in the program.\nWe visited every booth and dropped off a brochure and a spoke about our program. In addition to the brochure we drove the 2008 robot past all of the booths using the inverter, which attracted quite a few people to our booth. \nWe presented on stage from 3-3:30 with a captive audience, Lauren, Justin, Matt H, and I spoke about FIRST, preseason, build season, awards, and how people can support our team.\nAs for team members in attendance we had 7 or 8 that stayed all day and a few who stopped by either in the morning or in the afternoon.\n\nMoving to our To Do list for this week... Here are a few keys things we need to focus on:\n1. Management members attending the school activities fair TOMORROW during all four lunches.\n2.Entrance basket for B@B, what to include, where to get it from.\n3. Driver selection for B@B, hopefully Thursday night we can have a Driver Tryout and select 2 or 3 teams of drivers for the event.\n4. Double check with Mr. Sunblade about our transportation situation\n5. Fundraisers and the trip along Route 44 for donations, this needs to be arranged asap. (I have compiled an Assets/Liabilities spreadsheet for usto discuss at some point...)\n6. Registering for the regional (Opens September 30th, and i don''t think we [the students] can do that)\n\nJust as a side note, Ameya, can you either post the minutes for Avon Day or use a derivation of the notes above?\n\nThanks,\n\nName Here"[/size]\n\n[h2]What weâ€™ve learned[/h2]\n\n-Recruitment should be a high priority and should be focused on towards the end of the year and over the summer.\n-Visit the middle school during the day sometime in the spring\n-Talk to the incoming freshmen class at step-up day and orientation\n-Make personal connections with interested freshmen.\n-Include freshmen especially during first few meetings in interesting activity, with long speeches.\n-Be interesting and fun\n-Create a nice balance between fundraisers and robodemos.\n         -space them out throughout the pre-season and plan them out\n-Donâ€™t wait until the last minute to plan stuff\n-Make a to-do list for the week ahead and follow up on it\n         -Delegate jobs and assign responsibilities\n-Make management in-person meetings over the summer and establish weekly teleconferences\n-Find a place to print brochures and do it ahead of time\n-Make sure you have a practice space\n-Decide which awards the team wants to go for and donâ€™t save them all for build season\n-Do stuff for the community (pay it forward)\n-Update all team necessities well before build season\n         -ie: safety stuff\n         -cleanup day\n         -Handbook\n         -Tri-Fold\n\n[h2]Money Handling[/h2]\nSteps to follow after a successful fundraiser:\n1. Two members of management must count money raised at every event. (Treasurer and President)\n2. Record amount raised in ledger\n3. Place funds in a sealed envelope. (Include Date, total money enclosed, and a description of funds)\n4. Signature of treasurer on envelope\n5. Give envelope to Mrs. Muller the next business day\n\n[b]Other Tips[/b]\n-Make sure you double count every fundraisers donations, having an accurate number is critical!\n-Record all transactions in the ledger immediately after an event, otherwise you may forget which event the money came from.\n-NEVER leave money in the cash box! (unless it is pizza Money!)\n\n\n\nHope this helped!!\n[size=25]Ethan[/size]'),

If the conditional statement is true, then one set of code will be executed; otherwise, a different set of code will be executed. In traditional C code, an if statement looks like this:<br/>\n<code>\nif( conditional ){<br/>\nÂ Â Â statements if true<br/>\n}else{<br/>\nÂ Â Â statements if false<br/>\n}<br/>\n</code>\n<p>The <code>conditional</code> will evaluate to a boolean expression (either TRUE or FALSE). This will tell which section of code to execute. If the conditional is TRUE, then the statements within the first set of <code> { } </code> will be executed. If the conditional is FALSE, then the statements within the brackets of <code>else</code> will be executed. \n<br/>\n<p>\nIn LabVIEW, if statements are called case structures. A boolean value is wired to the input terminal, and there will be two cases: TRUE and FALSE. Put code to be executed in either condition in the corresponding part of the case structure. \n</p>\n<a href="http://www.ni.com/gettingstarted/labviewbasics/exestructures.htm#Case%20Structures">More Information</a>\n<br/>\n<a href="#top">Top of Page</a>\n<br/><br/>\n'),

Make note of modName, as this will be needed later.</li>\n<li> Make module directory<br/>\n	- In the /modules directory, ceate a new subdirectory named mod_modName<br/>\n	- In that directory, create a PHP file named mod.php\n	- In that PHP file, start with the basic module template (in Module Template.txt)<br/>\n	- Add an image named icon.png to the directory - \n		This image is the module icon shown in the add module list.\n		This image should be 16x16<br/></li>\n<li> Create the Module <br/>\n	- Make the following modifications to the template:<ul>\n		<li> fill in header comment </li>\n		<li> rename the class to mod_modName (make sure this is consistant!)</li>\n		<li> make title, description, and path variables into what they should be</li>\n		<li> in the setup function, make the sqlNames and sqlDefaults variables into whatever is appropriate</li>\n		<li> add code as needed to the render, renderEdit, and edit functions (see comments for description of what goes where)</li>\n		<li> make sure to comment your code so future webmasters can decipher it!</li><ul></li></ol>'),

If the conditional statement is true, then one set of code will be executed; otherwise, a different set of code will be executed. In traditional C code, an if statement looks like this:<br/>\n<code>\nif( conditional ){<br/>\nÂ Â Â statements if true<br/>\n}else{<br/>\nÂ Â Â statements if false<br/>\n}<br/>\n</code>\n<p>The <code>conditional</code> will evaluate to a boolean expression (either TRUE or FALSE). This will tell which section of code to execute. If the conditional is TRUE, then the statements within the first set of <code> { } </code> will be executed. If the conditional is FALSE, then the statements within the brackets of <code>else</code> will be executed. \n<br/>\n<p>\nIn LabVIEW, if statements are called case structures. A boolean value is wired to the input terminal, and there will be two cases: TRUE and FALSE.

The two most common are <a href="#while">While Loops</a> and <a href="#for">For Loops</a>. </p><p>Loops in LabVIEW are contained in a structure similar to a case structure. The code inside them will be repeated until the conditional statement returns false.</p>\n<a href="http://www.ni.com/gettingstarted/labviewbasics/exestructures.htm#Loops">More Information</a><br/>Information on <a href="http://www.ni.com/gettingstarted/labviewbasics/shiftregisters.htm">Passing Information Between Iterations</a><br/>\n<a href="#top">Top of Page</a>\n<br/><br/>\n\n<h3 id=''while''>While Loops</h3>\n<p>A While loop is a set of code that repeats until a given boolean is false. This kind of loop can be thought of as a repeating if statement. Every iteration, the loop checks the boolean value. If the value is true, the code will be executed, if the value is false, the loop will be skipped over and the next line of code executed. In traditional C, while loop syntax is as follows: <br/>\n<code>\nwhile( conditional ){ <br/>\nÂ Â Â statements while loop is true <br/>\n}<br/>\n</code>\nFirst, the <code>conditional</code> is checked. If that is true, then the statements within the loops brackets will continue to be executed until the <code>conditional</code> is false.</p>\n<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/While_loop">More Information</a><br/>\n<p>In LabVIEW, code will be executed until a condition occurs. The loop can be configured to stop on a TRUE or on a FALSE boolean value (the default is to stop on TRUE).</p>\n<a href="#top">Top of Page</a>\n<br/><br/>\n\n<h3 id=''for''>For Loops</h3>\n<p>The for loop is another type of loop; it''s also similar to the while loop. The main difference is that the for loop is based on the number of iterations and it is easier to work with iterations. In traditional C, the for loop syntax is as follows:<br/>\n<code>\nfor (i = 0; i &lt; 5; i++){<br/>\nÂ Â Â Statements to be Repeated<br/>\n}<br/>\n</code>\nThere are three arguments to the for loop. The first (<code>i = 0</code>) is the initialization. There is a variable (<code>i</code>), and a statement setting it equal to something (in this case zero). Every time this loop executes, the variable <code>i</code> be set to the value of zero. The next arguement is the conditional. This loop will execute as long as the value for <code>i</code> is less than 5. Once that statement is false, the loop will stop. The final argument of the for loop is what will happen upon the loop''s completion of an iteration. In this case, one will be added to the value of <code>i</code>.</p>\n<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/For_loop">More Information</a><br/>\n<p>In LabVIEW, for loops are different. They are strictly iteration based. The user must wire terminal for the number to times for the loop to execute. As long that is true, the code in the structure will continue to be executed.</p>\n<a href="#top">Top of Page</a>\n<br/><br/>'),

Robots could only use special, slippery wheels, and they competed on a slippery surface of white, plasticy material called "regolith." The game was designed to simulate low gravity conditions in a lunar environment. To continue the theme, the gamepieces were small, light balls called "moonrocks." Robots started the game possessing up to 7 moonrocks, and many more were strewn throughout the field. Human players outside the field threw moonrocks at the trailers attached to each robot to score. Robots could also score on other robots by putting moonrocks into their opponents'' robots'' trailers.\n<br>\n<br>\n\nWe built our robot, Vortex, around possessing as many moonrocks as possible and being able to score them from a range. The main body had a sweeper that swept moonrocks into a spiral, which fed them up to the cannon. The cannon was aimed by a camera, which tracked the vision targets on the opposing alliance''s trailers. Our systems team also created a sophisticated traction control system with encoders to minimize slippage on the slick field. As the competition progressed we modified our cannon to allow us to quickly dump multiple moon rocks into opponents'' trailers at close range.\n<br>\n<br>\n\nAfter a tough build season, our first event was the Suffield Shakedown, hosted by Aces High team 176, which we won on an alliance with teams 195 and 126. After that event, we competed in the Connecticut Regional. Although we didn''t make it as far as we had in previous years, we won the Rockwell Automation Innovation in Control Award for our traction control system and autonomous mode.\n<br>\n<br>\n\nAs with every past year, we competed in Atlanta, Georgia, in the Championship. The competition was great and a lot of fun, and we managed to make it to the quarterfinals on the Galileo Field, where we were eliminated by the alliance that went on to win the entire Championship.'),

(498, 'code', '<h2 style="color:#bf0000; font-weight:bold">2009-2010: A real BreakAway</h2>\n<br>\nIn 2010, FIRST kicked off BreakAway, a game that looked a lot like soccer on the surface. The field was split into 3 sections by two 1-foot-tall bumps with tunnels in the middle, which allowed smaller robots to move between the sections without going over the bump. Robots were allowed to have kickers to kick the balls into 1 of the 2 goals per alliance at each corner of the field, for a total of 4 goals. Where the game stopped looking like soccer was at the end, where teams could climb up towers in the middle of the field for bonus points.\n<br>\n<br>\nWe knew we wanted our robot to be light, small, and maneuverable so we could quickly score as many soccer balls as possible, and so that we could move between sections of the field via the tunnels. In past years, we had always built our robot to do everything that it could. However, this year, because hanging was only worth 2 points, and soccer balls scored were worth 1 each, we decided that it made more sense to focus on scoring over hanging. Our robot, Striker, used a new drive system for us which gave each wheel a separate motor used window motors to turn the front and back wheels together.

Though we thought we may have over-extended ourselves, everyone was supportive and helped make last-minute changes at competition. After our final seeding match we were ranked 34th, but teams 177 (Bobcat Robotics of South Windsor) and 176 (Aces High from Suffield and Windsor Locks High Schools) had faith in our team and chose us to be their alliance partner. With a lot of team work and a little luck, the UberBots and our alliance partners battled our way to the top to win the UTC New England regional.\n<br>\nOur regional win that year qualified us for the 2006 national competition in Atlanta, and the long haul from Connecticut was definitely worth it. The memories created there will be with the team forever. The UberBots also competed in Battlecry @ WPI in June, and Bash @ the Beach in October, an offseason event that we participate in to this day. The Bash @ the Beach was a great competition for our team because it allowed us to work in a competitive yet low-key environment with the new year''s team, as it takes place in October. We allied with teams 190 (Gompei Herd of Worchester, MA) and 500 (Waterford''s Team USA) and placed second. We also received an "All Business" award commending "the team that is most serious about their robotics and their fun."\n'),

Our robot, which we named "Dynamite" included a 2-joint arm (with a "wrist" and "shoulder" motor and a gripper for a hand) which gave us great flexibility since we could both score by putting tubes on the rack and get points back by removing "spoiler" game pieces. Dynamite also had a set of deployable ramps long enough to hold two robots, which earned us bonus points. Dynamite also had hefty bumpers that allowed us to play defense if we needed to, and an autonomous mode with 16 different functions that allowed us to automatically raise Dynamite''s arm to different heights and other useful things.\n<br>\nWe were able to "Rack ''n'' Roll" our way to the top, finishing as an alliance captain (in the top 8), and we ultimately won the UTC Connecticut Regional with team 195 (the CyberKnights of Southington) and team 558 (the RoboSquad from New Haven). For the second year in a row, we traveled to Atlanta to compete in the nationals, ending up in the Newton division again. This time, however, we were ranked third after the division seeding matches, and allied with  teams 1592 (the Bionic Tigers from Cocoa, FL) and 1816 (The Green Machine, all the way from Edina, Minnesota!). Our powerful alliance brought us all the way to the division finals. The UberBots continued to Einstein as the backup bot for Newton''s champion. After the Championship, we competed at Battlecry @ WPI, hosted by team 190, where we seeded 1st for the first time ever.\n<br>'),

The field was split into 3 sections by two 1-foot-tall bumps with tunnels in the middle, which allowed smaller robots to move between the sections without going over the bump. Robots were allowed to have kickers to kick the balls into 1 of the 2 goals per alliance at each corner of the field, for a total of 4 goals. Where the game stopped looking like soccer was at the end, where teams could climb up towers in the middle of the field for bonus points.\n<br>\nWe knew we wanted our robot to be light, small, and maneuverable so we could quickly score as many soccer balls as possible, and so that we could move between sections of the field via the tunnels. In past years, we had always built our robot to do everything that it could. However, this year, because hanging was only worth 2 points, and soccer balls scored were worth 1 each, we decided that it made more sense to focus on scoring over hanging. Our robot, Striker, used a new drive system for us which gave each wheel a separate motor used window motors to turn the front and back wheels together.

Teams could also earn points by "hurdling" the track balls over the 9-foot "overpass" in the middle of the field. The field was divided the long way down the center to give it a race-track feel. We responded to these aspects of the game in many ways as we designed and built our robot that year, Lightning.\n<br>\n<br>\nWe gave Lightning a two-speed transmission so that we could have both the speed to make it around the track and the precision to pick up the large track balls. To pick up and handle the large balls, we gave Lightning a 2-joint arm and a claw that could expand to wrap around the ball, then contract to keep possession of the ball as we moved around the field.\n<br>\n<br>\nWe built a second robot and a replica of the field in the space donated to us by Reflexite so that we could practice driving even after we had shipped our robot off after build season. We attended the Suffield Shakedown 2008 Scrimmage hosted by Team 176, Aces High. The competition was good practice for the new 2008 season''s team, and it let us see how other teams had tackled the challenges of the game. Allied with team 230 (the Gaelhawks) and team 1784 (the Litchbots), we won the scrimmage undefeated. Our team was also successful off the field, winning the spirit award for the first time ever. We were looking forward to how we would fare at the Connecticut regional.\n<br>\n<br>\nAt the Connecticut Regional, we won all our qualification matches, allied with numerous other great teams, and placed first in seeding among the 62 teams at the competition. This was a mark of progress for our team, as only two years ago we had had to fix our robot after every match. For the elimination matches, we allied with team 175 (Buzz Robotics) and team 716 (the Who''s-C-Teks). Through the quarterfinals, semifinals, and finals, our alliance went undefeated, winning the Connecticut Regional. During the award ceremony, we were honored with the Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers Entrepreneurship Award, recognizing our work in the community.\n<br>\n<br>\nIn 2008, the UberBots also competed in the Championship in Atlanta. In qualification, we achieved a 6-1 record, becoming the captains of the third alliance. We invited teams 1024 and 177 to be part of our alliance, creating a well-rounded team that could handle any situation on the field. Our alliance won in the quarterfinals and the semifinals, leading us to the finals where we faced another strong alliance captained by team 987. With past world champions and multiple regional winners on both sides, the competition was intense, but our alliance pulled through to become the champions of the Archimedes field. We advanced to the Einstein field, where we played teams who had advanced from other divisions. Our alliance faced even tougher competition there, but we became international semifinalists. 2008 was a great year for the UberBots. We went undefeated in all our regionals, and advanced all the way to the world semifinals in Atlanta.\n<br>\n<br>\n<h2 style="color:#bf0000; font-weight:bold">2008-2009: Absolute Lunacy</h2>\n<br>\nIn 2009, the game was Lunacy. Robots could only use special, slippery wheels, and they competed on a slippery surface of white, plasticy material called "regolith." The game was designed to simulate low gravity conditions in a lunar environment. To continue the theme, the gamepieces were small, light balls called "moonrocks." Robots started the game possessing up to 7 moonrocks, and many more were strewn throughout the field. Human players outside the field threw moonrocks at the trailers attached to each robot to score. Robots could also score on other robots by putting moonrocks into their opponents'' robots'' trailers.\n<br>\n<br>\n\nWe built our robot, Vortex, around possessing as many moonrocks as possible and being able to score them from a range. The main body had a sweeper that swept moonrocks into a spiral, which fed them up to the cannon. The cannon was aimed by a camera, which tracked the vision targets on the opposing alliance''s trailers. Our systems team also created a sophisticated traction control system with encoders to minimize slippage on the slick field. As the competition progressed we modified our cannon to allow us to quickly dump multiple moon rocks into opponents'' trailers at close range.\n<br>\n<br>\n\nAfter a tough build season, our first event was the Suffield Shakedown, hosted by Aces High team 176, which we won on an alliance with teams 195 and 126. After that event, we competed in the Connecticut Regional. Although we didn''t make it as far as we had in previous years, we won the Rockwell Automation Innovation in Control Award for our traction control system and autonomous mode.\n<br>\n<br>\n\nAs with every past year, we competed in Atlanta, Georgia, in the Championship. The competition was great and a lot of fun, and we managed to make it to the quarterfinals on the Galileo Field, where we were eliminated by the alliance that went on to win the entire Championship.'),

Although we didn''t make it as far as we had in previous years, we won the Rockwell Automation Innovation in Control Award for our traction control system and autonomous mode.\n<br>\n<br>\nAs with every past year, we competed in Atlanta, Georgia, in the Championship. The competition was great and a lot of fun, and we managed to make it to the quarterfinals on the Galileo Field, where we were eliminated by the alliance that went on to win the entire Championship.'),

The field was split into 3 sections by two 1-foot-tall bumps with tunnels in the middle, which allowed smaller robots to move between the sections without going over the bump. Robots were allowed to have kickers to kick the balls into 1 of the 2 goals per alliance at each corner of the field, for a total of 4 goals. Where the game stopped looking like soccer was at the end, where teams could climb up towers in the middle of the field for bonus points.\n\nWe knew we wanted our robot to be light, small, and maneuverable so we could quickly score as many soccer balls as possible, and so that we could move between sections of the field via the tunnels. In past years, we had always built our robot to do everything that it could. However, this year, because hanging was only worth 2 points, and soccer balls scored were worth 1 each, we decided that it made more sense to focus on scoring over hanging. Our robot, Striker, used a new drive system for us which gave each wheel a separate motor used window motors to turn the front and back wheels together. This allowed us to make tight turns and maneuver past defending robots to score. Though we built a pneumatic kicker that was quite effective, we mostly scored by "herding" or rolling soccer balls into the goals.\n\nThe UberBots had big plans for the 2010 season. Not only were we going to compete at 2 regionals for the first time ever, but we were planning to go for the Chairman''s Award. The Chairman''s award is the most prestigious Award given out by FIRST, to a team that spreads the message of FIRST, appreciation of science and technology, throughout their community. We had participated in many demos at schools and public places, and put together a video and an essay for the application.\n\nOur first regional was the WPI Regional. It was an early competition, so many teams, including us, were not in our prime. We only made it to the quarterfinals, where we were eliminated. However, we won the Chairman''s Award at WPI, even if we didn''t make it to the semifinals. We also won the Delphi Engineering Excellence Award for our robot''s elegant and simple design. The WPI Regional ended up going great, and it was good practice for our next event.\n\nThe Connecticut Regional was a fantastic event for the UberBots in 2010. We went undefeated throughout seeding and elimination matches, winning the the competition on an alliance with Team 102 (The Gearheads) and Team 383 (Brazilian Machine). Since our robot was offensive, we scored high and also won the Coopertition award, which calculated points based on both our score and our opponents'' score after each match. We had also helped numerous teams on other alliances during the competition, which is part of the Coopertition award. Because of our complex drive system which allowed us to switch between a swerve drive for tight turns, a rotated drive for kicking, and other modes, we were again awarded the Rockwell Innovation in Control Award.\n\nThe UberBots again went to Atlanta to compete in the Championship. The competition was intense, and we were eliminated in the quarter finals of our division. However, we still placed well overall because our robot was able to score many balls quickly.\n\nWith many of our members outgoing seniors, and the loss of our practice spaces on the horizon, the UberBots were looking forward to a challenging 2011 season...<br>'),

(551, 'code', '<h1>About Our Website</h1>\nAt the beginning of 2010, the UberBots decided they needed to design a new website. When considering why the old one had not worked as well as they wanted, they determined that if the website''s code and content were interlaced, the site would be impossible for a non-programmer to maintain and would be harder to add code onto. Also, the process of creating individual pages was too difficult. How then, could code be separated from content and pages be creating with a single click. At that point, the UberBots website team conceptualized what they coined "OmniPage" system. It would function as a content management system with complete modularity. Six months later, the new UberBots website was ready to hit the web!\n\nThe OmniPage system, run by the OmniCore, can be summed up it the following diagram:\n<img src="http://uberbots.org/omni/media/omnicore.png" />\nFor the presentation the website team gave the the rest of the UberBots regarding the OmniPage system, go <a href="http://uberbots.org/omni/media/files/Old%20Website%20Files/Website%20Proposal.ppt">here</a> (.ppt).\n\n<h2>More Information:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href="http://uberbots.org/o/about/our_website/focuses">Website Focuses</a></li>\n<li><a href="http://uberbots.org/o/about/our_website/behind_the_scenes">Behind the Scenes</a></li>\n<li><a href="http://uberbots.org/o/about/our_website/advantages">Advantages of the OmniPage System</a>\n<li><a href="http://uberbots.org/documentation">Website Documentation</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h1>Other Projects by the UberBots'' Website Team</h1>\n<p>\nThe UberBots'' Website Team has also made other projects.

When considering why the old one had not worked as well as they wanted, they determined that if the website''s code and content were interlaced, the site would be impossible for a non-programmer to maintain and would be harder to add code onto. Also, the process of creating individual pages was too difficult. How then, could code be separated from content and pages be creating with a single click. At that point, the UberBots website team conceptualized what they coined "OmniPage" system. It would function as a content management system with complete modularity. Six months later, the new UberBots website was ready to hit the web!\n\nThe OmniPage system, run by the OmniCore, can be summed up it the following diagram:\n<img src="http://uberbots.org/omni/media/omnicore.png" />\nFor the presentation the website team gave the the rest of the UberBots regarding the OmniPage system, go <a href="http://uberbots.org/omni/media/files/Old%20Website%20Files/Website%20Proposal.ppt">here</a> (.ppt).\n\n<h2>More Information:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href="http://uberbots.org/o/about/our_website/focuses">Website Focuses</a></li>\n<li><a href="http://uberbots.org/o/about/our_website/behind_the_scenes">Behind the Scenes</a></li>\n<li><a href="http://uberbots.org/o/about/our_website/advantages">Advantages of the OmniPage System</a>\n<li><a href="http://uberbots.org/documentation">Website Documentation</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Some other things we''re proud of:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>W3 Validation</li>\n<li>Breakthough menu navigation - better than anything we''ve seen on any other website</li>\n<li>PHPBB Integration with the calendar, users, and permissions</li>\n<li>A website made <i>for</i> our community, students, parents, and mentors <i>by</i> our website team, <i>maintained by</i> our entire team.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h1>Other Projects by the UberBots'' Website Team</h1>\n<p>\nThe UberBots'' Website Team has also made other projects.

The [url=http://bbcode.org]bbCode[/url] module will output parsed bbCode, a safe and simple way to provide formatting, commonly used on web forums.\nThe OmniPage system is also a skinnable engine.

A green LED shines when the switch is on and a red LED shines when the switch is off. There are many usually many switches in a row. Additionally, each switch is connected to a Digital Input/Output (DIO) on a controller that reads "1" when the switch is on and "0" when the switch is off. This way, inputs can be passed to the robot, and the LEDs indicate the state of the switch to the driver.\n\nSwitchboxes may be connected to the Cypress FirstTouch PSoC 3 (which is connected to the operator console) or may be connected directly to the digital sidecar, setting configurations on the robot, such as for autonomous mode. Either way, the switchbox requires one DIO for each switch, a power source (VDD), and ground (VSS). Each switch requires either two LEDS or a biLED (three pins and can shine two different colors), a 1KÎ© resistor (a pulldown for the LEDs), a 10KÎ© resistor (a pullup for the DIO signal), and a single pole, double throw toggle switch (one common connects to one of two poles depending on its position). This list also assumes a lot of wires.\n\nSwitchboxes work well mounted inside a plastic (ABS) project box from RadioShack. If you''re using it with the PSoc, you may want to find a box that can hold the PSoC inside. The top can be drilled or milled in a CNC machine.\n\nNotice that one resistor is used for every two LEDs (or one biLED, if you wish). If the two LEDs are going to run simultaneously, this is bad practice and should not be done. However, since the switch will only allow one LED to run at a time, using only one resistor is safe and advisable.\n\nThe schematic at right shows a four-switch switchbox, however it should be easy to scale to whatever size is necessary. The "+5V" doesn''t need to be exactly 5 volts. The 3.3 volts on the PSoC or the 6 volts on the sidecar should work fine.

It''s basically a box with switches and LEDs. A green LED shines when the switch is on and a red LED shines when the switch is off. There are many usually many switches in a row. Additionally, each switch is connected to a Digital Input/Output (DIO) on a controller that reads "1" when the switch is on and "0" when the switch is off. This way, inputs can be passed to the robot, and the LEDs indicate the state of the switch to the driver.\n\nSwitchboxes may be connected to the Cypress FirstTouch PSoC 3 (which is connected to the operator console) or may be connected directly to the digital sidecar, setting configurations on the robot, such as for autonomous mode. Either way, the switchbox requires one DIO for each switch, a power source (VDD), and ground (VSS). Each switch requires either two LEDS or a biLED (three pins and can shine two different colors), a 1KÎ© resistor (a pulldown for the LEDs), a 10KÎ© resistor (a pullup for the DIO signal), and a single pole, double throw toggle switch (one common connects to one of two poles depending on its position). This list also assumes a lot of wires.\n\nSwitchboxes work well mounted inside a plastic (ABS) project box from RadioShack. If you''re using it with the PSoc, you may want to find a box that can hold the PSoC inside. The top can be drilled or milled in a CNC machine.\n\nNotice that one resistor is used for every two LEDs (or one biLED, if you wish). If the two LEDs are going to run simultaneously, this is bad practice and should not be done. However, since the switch will only allow one LED to run at a time, using only one resistor is safe and advisable.\n\nThe schematic at right shows a four-switch switchbox, however it should be easy to scale to whatever size is necessary. The "+5V" doesn''t need to be exactly 5 volts. The 3.3 volts on the PSoC or the 6 volts on the sidecar should work fine.

(594, 'code', '<h1>About Our Website</h1>\nAt the beginning of 2010, the UberBots decided they needed to design a new website. When considering why the old one had not worked as well as they wanted, they determined that if the website''s code and content were interlaced, the site would be impossible for a non-programmer to maintain and would be harder to add code onto. Also, the process of creating individual pages was too difficult. How then, could code be separated from content and pages be creating with a single click. At that point, the UberBots website team conceptualized what they coined "OmniPage" system. It would function as a content management system with complete modularity. Six months later, the new UberBots website was ready to hit the web!\n\nThe OmniPage system, run by the OmniCore, can be summed up it the following diagram:\n<img src="http://uberbots.org/omni/media/omnicore.png" />\nFor the presentation the website team gave the the rest of the UberBots regarding the OmniPage system, go <a href="http://uberbots.org/omni/media/files/Old%20Website%20Files/Website%20Proposal.ppt">here</a> (.ppt).\n\n<h2>More Information:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href="http://uberbots.org/o/about/our_website/focuses">Website Focuses</a></li>\n<li><a href="http://uberbots.org/o/about/our_website/behind_the_scenes">Behind the Scenes</a></li>\n<li><a href="http://uberbots.org/o/about/our_website/advantages">Advantages of the OmniPage System</a>\n<li><a href="http://uberbots.org/o/documentation">Website Documentation</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Some other things we''re proud of:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>W3 Validation</li>\n<li>Breakthough menu navigation - better than anything we''ve seen on any other website (and all automatically generated)</li>\n<li>PHPBB Integration with the calendar, users, and permissions</li>\n<li>A website made <i>for</i> our community, students, parents, and mentors <i>by</i> our website team, <i>maintained by</i> our entire team.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h1>Other Projects by the UberBots'' Website Team</h1>\n<p>\nThe UberBots'' Website Team has also made other projects. They have made <a href="http://sixdegrees.uberbots.org">Six Degrees of FIRST</a>, a tool that finds the shortest path between two FRC teams using match alliances in the past. The Team has also made websites for UberBots <a href="http://alumni.uberbots.org">alumni</a>. This tool helps them stay in contact with the team as well as provide team history and a reminder the years they spent with Team 1124.\n</p>'),
(595, 'code', '<h1 id="nav">Website Focuses</h1>\n<p>When designing the OmniPage system, the UberBots website team had six main focus areas. They are: </p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href="#modular">Modular</a></li>\n<li><a href="#integrated">Integrated</a></li>\n<li><a href="#compliant">Compliant</a></li>\n<li><a href="#accessible">Handicap Accessible</a></li>\n<li><a href="#simple">Transparent/Simple</a></li>\n<li><a href="#visual">Visually Pleasing</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Return to <a href="http://uberbots.org/o/about/our_website">About our Website</a> page.</p>\n\n<h2 id="modular">Modular</h2>\n<p><img src="http://uberbots.org/omni/media/modular.png" style="float:left;padding-right:5px;" alt=''modular''/> Modularity is an important focus for the website because "it will be easier to fix bugs, keep compliance, keep uniformity, prevent errors, make editing easier, make coding simpler, and enhance the browsing experience" - Matt Howard, UberBots Forums. Having a modular website would replace the older system of individually coding pages from scratch. This system scatters code and makes it more difficult to program and maintain.  When pages include modules, or building blocks, it will make it much easier to build and keep a quality website. <br/>\nThe OmniPage system uses modules to keep content. Modules are building blocks for the website: a block of predefined code that serves a specific purpose. Different modules on the website keep content in a logical place and make for an overall better website and browsing experience.<br/><a href="#top">Top of Page</a></p>\n\n<h2 id="integrated">Integrated</h2>\n<p><img src=''http://uberbots.org/omni/media/integrated.png'' style="float:left;padding-right:5px;" alt=''integrated''/>The OmniPage system is integrated with many current technologies. First, the website is integrated with the UberBots <a href="http://uberbots.org/forums">Forums</a>, which provide login credentials and simplified permissions for administrative functions. This concept increases efficiency by only having the website files deal with one set of credentials and user properties. This not only reduces coding on the programming end, but also makes people only have to remember one set of login information. This integration will also simplify the ability to link calendar events to forum posts, for easily accessible meeting minutes and other information and discussion regarding meetings and events.<br/>\nThe website is also integrated with other websites and technologies. It helps to create a better website by helping people stay connected and informed with team happenings (see <a href="http://uberbots.org/o/about/our_website/advantages#communication">here</a>). Some technologies integrated into the OmniPage system include YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, RSS, and iCal.<br/><a href="#top">Top of Page</a></p>\n\n<h2 id="compliant">Compliant</h2>\n<p><img src="http://uberbots.org/omni/media/compliant.png" style="float:left;padding-right:5px;" alt=''compliant'' /> <a href="http://w3.org">The World Wide Web Consortium</a> (W3C) provides standards for the web. It is important to comply with these standards because it makes for a better website. These standards define how the web should be, and the UberBots want their website to be as current as possible, without sacrificing quality in older browsers. The website should look and function well in all major browsers, including Microsoft Internet Explorer (at least version 7), Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, Apple Safari, and Opera. Additionally, important technologies like RSS and iCal are important to have functioning, as they help enhance the browsing experience.<br/><a href="#top">Top of Page</a></p>\n\n<h2 id="accessible">Handicap Accessible</h2>\n<p><img src="http://uberbots.org/omni/media/accessible.png" style="float:left;padding-right:5px;" alt=''handicap accessible''/>Having a handicap accessible website ensures that everybody can see and enjoy the content, even if they are blind, deaf, or vision impaired. There are some easy things that can be done to make an accessible website, including alternate text for images, variable text size on pages, and captions in videos and animations. Having an accessible website will help to make sure the maximum amount of people can get the message of the UberBots and <a href=''http://uberbots.org/o/about/first''>FIRST</a>.<br/><a href="#top">Top of Page</a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p>\n\n<h2 id="simple"> Transparent & Simple</h2>\n<p><img src="http://uberbots.org/omni/media/simple.png" style="float:left;padding-right:5px;" />Simplicity is an important aspect of a good website. It is important to have a <a href="http://uberbots.org/o/sitemap">sitemap</a>. A sitemap helps users find the page they are looking for without too much trouble. It will also help search engines find pages on the site; this helps expose more people to resources on the site. Additionally, URLs of the site should be simple and easy to figure out. An example of this is the URL "uberbots.org/o/about/our_website." It is easy to figure out that this URL will lead to a page that talks about the website. Having simple URLs makes the site easier to navigate. Finally, the layout of the site should also be as informative as possible, but also as simple as possible. Keeping simplicity in the layouts makes sure that content is easy to find and can get all information necessary across to the end user.<br/><a href="#top">Top of Page</a></p> \n\n<h2 id="visual">Visually Pleasing</h2>\n<p><img src="http://uberbots.org/omni/media/visual.png" style="float:left;padding-right:5px;" />Having an ascetically pleasing website in the final focus of the OmniPage system. It is important to have a site that is nice to look at and makes the user enjoy looking at the site. Today, there are many websites that aren''t visually pleasing, and many users feel like visiting those sites is unnecessarily difficult. The OmniPage system has the ability to be visually pleasing through the use of skins. Skins are a set of HTML files separate from other parts of the site. The skin files are what actually take the data from modules and output it to a page (for more information on skins, go <a href="http://uberbots.org/o/about/our_website/advantages#skins">here</a>). The final output of the site should not be too cluttered and all content should be easily viewable in an easy to look at manor. Having a visually pleasing website could be the difference between an user returning to the site or not, so it''s important to make sure the looks of the site work in its favor.<br/><a href="#top">Top of Page</a></p>'),
(596, 'code', '<h1 id="nav">The Advantages of the OmniPage System</h1>\n<p>The OmniPage system makes it very easy to edit content on the site. Although the site may look normal based on its final output, there is actually a lot of complex code going on behind the scenes to make the administrator''s job a lot easier. </p>\n<br/>\n<ul>\n<li><a href="#pages">Pages</a></li>\n<li><a href="#modules">Modules</a></li>\n<li><a href="#skins">Skins</a></li>\n<li><a href="#communication">Communication</a></li>\n<li><a href="#security">Security</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Retrn to <a href=''http://uberbots.org/o/about/our_website''>About Our Website</a> page</p>\n\n<h2 id=''pages''>Pages</h2>\n<p>Pages in this system are stored in the database. The OmniCore will find the correct page in the database, and return all of the content associated with that page. Having pages stored in the database makes it very easy to create pages, modify their properties, and delete them. Below is the form for creating a page.\n<img src=''http://uberbots.org/omni/media/addPage.png'' alt=''add page form'' style="border:1px solid #CCC"/><br/><a href="#top">Top of Page</a></p>\n\n<h2 id="modules">Modules</h2>\n<p><img src=''http://uberbots.org/omni/media/editbox.png'' alt=''edit page dropdown box'' style="float:right;padding-left:5px;"/>Adding and modifying content on a page is very easy to do, and does not require knowledge of HTML or PHP. All that is required is the addition of a module, is for the user to click on the edit button at the top of the page and select "Add Module." The user then picks which module type to add and selects it. <br/>Modules are also very easy to edit. And administrator simply has to select "Edit Module" from the drop down box and select the module to edit. Then, a graphical method of editing the module will appear, as determined in the module PHP file. Then, once the edit has been made, the new information will be updated in the database.<br/>Administrators also have the ability to review edits made to a module. They can view past states of modules and revert to that state if necessary. All edits are stored in the database along with other information related to that edit, including the user, time, IP, and previous content. <br/>\nThis ability to easily edit content on the site is very important. It makes it so editing and maintaining the website is no longer a role for someone who knows HTML. Now, the website content is no longer directly tied to the source file, making for an easily modifiable and modular experience while using the site. <br/><a href="#top">Top of Page</a>\n</p>\n\n<h2 id="skins">Skins</h2>\n<p>The OmniPage system is also a skinnable system. The ability to use skins makes it much easier to change the website''s design. Previously, the programmers would have to completely change how the site works in the very low level files in order to change the formatting. With the OmniPage skin system, changing how the site looks is simply a matter of editing a skin file. Skin files are HTML, CSS, and Javascript files that manage how the site appears to the user. These files are passed dynamic content through the module files via special functions. This content is then displayed in the skin and shown to the end user. Now, when the website team would like to change how the site looks, they simply have to create a new skin with all the necessary files, instead of recoding the site. Skins can also be used to provide a dynamic viewing experience. A special skin can be used to simply shake things up or to make the site mobile device friendly. Either way, the ability to have skins is an important feature of the OmniPage system.<br/><a href="#top">Top of Page</a></p>\n\n<h2 id="communication">Communication</h2>\n<p><a href="http://facebook.com/TheUberBots"><img src="http://uberbots.org/omni/media/facebook.png" style="float:right;padding-left:5px;"/></a>\nThe OmniPage system also integrates communication with team members into its architecture. There is native support for emailing all team members, as well as other groups of users (as determined through the forums). The website also supports sending out mass SMS messages to those who signed up. The website will automatically send out a mass SMS 24 hours before any event on the calendar, ensuring team members are informed about upcoming events. These features come in handy for alerting team members to news regarding the team.<br/>\nThe OmniCore is also integrated with social networking. The UberBots <a href=''http://twitter.com/team1124''>Twitter</a> Account and <a href="http://facebook.com/TheUberBots">Facebook</a> fanpage are linked to the website, making is easy to update both.<br/><a href="http://twitter.com/team1124"><img src="http://uberbots.org/omni/media/twitter.png" /></a><br/><a href="#top">Top of Page</a></p>\n\n<h2 id="security">Security</h2>\n<p>The OmniPage also has native security features. All user accounts are integrated with the UberBots phpBB <a href="http://uberbots.org/forums">forums</a>. Having this integration removes the hassle of team members having multiple accounts (for both main site and forums), a problem encountered in previous websites. The usage of forums accounts created an "all in one" user account that works for the entire UberBots website. <br/>Using the forums accounts also provides simple security features. PhpBB has native usergroups, which the OmniCore uses to decide whether a user can see or edit a certain page. Some groups have global permissions while others can only deal with certain pages. Administrators also have the ability to give certain users or groups special permissions (that aren''t native) for certain pages. This helps with maintaining website content; now any user can be responsible for a certain page and make sure it''s up to date. This system also ensures security with regard to editing content.<br/>\nThe OmniPage system also has native log features. When an administrative action is carried out, the system will automatically append an entry to a log text file with important information regarding the edit. Username, time, and the action are recorded. This record of events helps ensure security with administrative features.<br/><a href="#top">Top of Page</a></p>\n'),

We are an organization working to promote science and technology not only in our school but also in our community. From our humble beginnings in 2003, we have grown immensely over the past six years gaining national recognition for our hard work and accomplishments. In addition, we are now the proud winners of four Connecticut regionals as well as winners of many community outreach awards. Finally, we have recently become a 501(c)(3) for our non-profit work promoting science education. More information about our team, its history, and its upcoming events can be found around our website.

Teams could also earn points by "hurdling" the track balls over the 9-foot "overpass" in the middle of the field. The field was divided the long way down the center to give it a race-track feel. We responded to these aspects of the game in many ways as we designed and built our robot that year, Lightning.\n<br>\n<br>\nWe gave Lightning a two-speed transmission so that we could have both the speed to make it around the track and the precision to pick up the large track balls. To pick up and handle the large balls, we gave Lightning a 2-joint arm and a claw that could expand to wrap around the ball, then contract to keep possession of the ball as we moved around the field.\n<br>\n<br>\nWe built a second robot and a replica of the field in the space donated to us by Reflexite so that we could practice driving even after we had shipped our robot off after build season. We attended the Suffield Shakedown 2008 Scrimmage hosted by Team 176, Aces High. The competition was good practice for the new 2008 season''s team, and it let us see how other teams had tackled the challenges of the game. Allied with team 230 (the Gaelhawks) and team 1784 (the Litchbots), we won the scrimmage undefeated. Our team was also successful off the field, winning the spirit award for the first time ever. We were looking forward to how we would fare at the Connecticut regional.\n<br>\n<br>\nAt the Connecticut Regional, we won all our qualification matches, allied with numerous other great teams, and placed first in seeding among the 62 teams at the competition. This was a mark of progress for our team, as only two years ago we had had to fix our robot after every match. For the elimination matches, we allied with team 175 (Buzz Robotics) and team 716 (the Who''s-C-Teks). Through the quarterfinals, semifinals, and finals, our alliance went undefeated, winning the Connecticut Regional. During the award ceremony, we were honored with the Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers Entrepreneurship Award, recognizing our work in the community.\n<br>\n<br>\nIn 2008, the UberBots also competed in the Championship in Atlanta. In qualification, we achieved a 6-1 record, becoming the captains of the third alliance. We invited teams 1024 and 177 to be part of our alliance, creating a well-rounded team that could handle any situation on the field. Our alliance won in the quarterfinals and the semifinals, leading us to the finals where we faced another strong alliance captained by team 987. With past world champions and multiple regional winners on both sides, the competition was intense, but our alliance pulled through to become the champions of the Archimedes field. We advanced to the Einstein field, where we played teams who had advanced from other divisions. Our alliance faced even tougher competition there, but we became international semifinalists. 2008 was a great year for the UberBots.

Robots could only use special, slippery wheels, and they competed on a slippery surface of white, plasticy material called "regolith." The game was designed to simulate low gravity conditions in a lunar environment. To continue the theme, the gamepieces were small, light balls called "moonrocks." Robots started the game possessing up to 7 moonrocks, and many more were strewn throughout the field. Human players outside the field threw moonrocks at the trailers attached to each robot to score. Robots could also score on other robots by putting moonrocks into their opponents'' robots'' trailers.\n<br>\n<br>\nWe built our robot, Vortex, around possessing as many moonrocks as possible and being able to score them from a range. The main body had a sweeper that swept moonrocks into a spiral, which fed them up to the cannon. The cannon was aimed by a camera, which tracked the vision targets on the opposing alliance''s trailers. Our systems team also created a sophisticated traction control system with encoders to minimize slippage on the slick field. As the competition progressed we modified our cannon to allow us to quickly dump multiple moon rocks into opponents'' trailers at close range.\n<br>\n<br>\nAfter a tough build season, our first event was the Suffield Shakedown, hosted by Aces High team 176, which we won on an alliance with teams 195 and 126. After that event, we competed in the Connecticut Regional. Although we didn''t make it as far as we had in previous years, we won the Rockwell Automation Innovation in Control Award for our traction control system and autonomous mode.\n<br>\n<br>\nAs with every past year, we competed in Atlanta, Georgia, in the Championship. The competition was great and a lot of fun, and we managed to make it to the quarterfinals on the Galileo Field, where we were eliminated by the alliance that went on to win the entire Championship.'),

The field was split into 3 sections by two 1-foot-tall bumps with tunnels in the middle, which allowed smaller robots to move between the sections without going over the bump. Robots were allowed to have kickers to kick the balls into 1 of the 2 goals per alliance at each corner of the field, for a total of 4 goals. Where the game stopped looking like soccer was at the end, where teams could climb up towers in the middle of the field for bonus points.\n\nWe knew we wanted our robot to be light, small, and maneuverable so we could quickly score as many soccer balls as possible, and so that we could move between sections of the field via the tunnels. In past years, we had always built our robot to do everything that it could. However, this year, because hanging was only worth 2 points, and soccer balls scored were worth 1 each, we decided that it made more sense to focus on scoring over hanging. Our robot, Striker, used a new drive system for us which gave each wheel a separate motor used window motors to turn the front and back wheels together. This allowed us to make tight turns and maneuver past defending robots to score. Though we built a pneumatic kicker that was quite effective, we mostly scored by "herding" or rolling soccer balls into the goals.\n\nThe UberBots had big plans for the 2010 season. Not only were we going to compete at 2 regionals for the first time ever, but we were planning to go for the Chairman''s Award. The Chairman''s award is the most prestigious Award given out by FIRST, to a team that spreads the message of FIRST, appreciation of science and technology, throughout their community. We had participated in many demos at schools and public places, and put together a video and an essay for the application.\n\nOur first regional was the WPI Regional. It was an early competition, so many teams, including us, were not in our prime. We only made it to the quarterfinals, where we were eliminated. However, we won the Chairman''s Award at WPI, even if we didn''t make it to the semifinals. We also won the Delphi Engineering Excellence Award for our robot''s elegant and simple design. The WPI Regional ended up going great, and it was good practice for our next event.\n\nThe Connecticut Regional was a fantastic event for the UberBots in 2010. We went undefeated throughout seeding and elimination matches, winning the the competition on an alliance with Team 102 (The Gearheads) and Team 383 (Brazilian Machine). Since our robot was offensive, we scored high and also won the Coopertition award, which calculated points based on both our score and our opponents'' score after each match. We had also helped numerous teams on other alliances during the competition, which is part of the Coopertition award. Because of our complex drive system which allowed us to switch between a swerve drive for tight turns, a rotated drive for kicking, and other modes, we were again awarded the Rockwell Innovation in Control Award.\n\nThe UberBots again went to Atlanta to compete in the Championship. The competition was intense, and we were eliminated in the quarter finals of our division.

Our robot, which we named "Dynamite" included a 2-joint arm (with a "wrist" and "shoulder" motor and a gripper for a hand) which gave us great flexibility since we could both score by putting tubes on the rack and get points back by removing "spoiler" game pieces. Dynamite also had a set of deployable ramps long enough to hold two robots, which earned us bonus points. Dynamite also had hefty bumpers that allowed us to play defense if we needed to, and an autonomous mode with 16 different functions that allowed us to automatically raise Dynamite''s arm to different heights and other useful things.\n\nWe were able to "Rack ''n'' Roll" our way to the top, finishing as an alliance captain (in the top 8), and we ultimately won the UTC Connecticut Regional with team 195 (the CyberKnights of Southington) and team 558 (the RoboSquad from New Haven). For the second year in a row, we traveled to Atlanta to compete in the nationals, ending up in the Newton division again. This time, however, we were ranked third after the division seeding matches, and allied with  teams 1592 (the Bionic Tigers from Cocoa, FL) and 1816 (The Green Machine, all the way from Edina, Minnesota!). Our powerful alliance brought us all the way to the division finals. The UberBots continued to Einstein as the backup bot for Newton''s champion.

Teams could also earn points by "hurdling" the track balls over the 9-foot "overpass" in the middle of the field. The field was divided the long way down the center to give it a race-track feel. We responded to these aspects of the game in many ways as we designed and built our robot that year, Lightning.\n<br>\n<br>\nWe gave Lightning a two-speed transmission so that we could have both the speed to make it around the track and the precision to pick up the large track balls. To pick up and handle the large balls, we gave Lightning a 2-joint arm and a claw that could expand to wrap around the ball, then contract to keep possession of the ball as we moved around the field.\n<br>\n<br>\nWe built a second robot and a replica of the field in the space donated to us by Reflexite so that we could practice driving even after we had shipped our robot off after build season. We attended the Suffield Shakedown 2008 Scrimmage hosted by Team 176, Aces High. The competition was good practice for the new 2008 season''s team, and it let us see how other teams had tackled the challenges of the game. Allied with team 230 (the Gaelhawks) and team 1784 (the Litchbots), we won the scrimmage undefeated. Our team was also successful off the field, winning the spirit award for the first time ever. We were looking forward to how we would fare at the Connecticut regional.\n<br>\n<br>\nAt the Connecticut Regional, we won all our qualification matches, allied with numerous other great teams, and placed first in seeding among the 62 teams at the competition. This was a mark of progress for our team, as only two years ago we had had to fix our robot after every match. For the elimination matches, we allied with team 175 (Buzz Robotics) and team 716 (the Who''s-C-Teks). Through the quarterfinals, semifinals, and finals, our alliance went undefeated, winning the Connecticut Regional. During the award ceremony, we were honored with the Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers Entrepreneurship Award, recognizing our work in the community.\n<br>\n<br>\nIn 2008, the UberBots also competed in the Championship in Atlanta. In qualification, we achieved a 6-1 record, becoming the captains of the third alliance. We invited teams 1024 and 177 to be part of our alliance, creating a well-rounded team that could handle any situation on the field. Our alliance won in the quarterfinals and the semifinals, leading us to the finals where we faced another strong alliance captained by team 987. With past world champions and multiple regional winners on both sides, the competition was intense, but our alliance pulled through to become the champions of the Archimedes field. We advanced to the Einstein field, where we played teams who had advanced from other divisions. Our alliance faced even tougher competition there, but we became international semifinalists. 2008 was a great year for the UberBots. We went undefeated in all our regionals, and advanced all the way to the world semifinals in Atlanta.\n<br>\n<h2 style="color:#bf0000; font-weight:bold">2008-2009: Absolute Lunacy</h2><div id="infoBox" style="float:right;"><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyER3MrNBZQ" target="blank" title="2009-Lunacy" alt="Lunacy"><image src="/omni/media/history/09game.jpg" style="  height:auto; width:160px;"></a><br><img src="/omni/media/history/09bot.jpg" title="Vortex" alt="Vortex" style=" height:200px; width:automatic;"></div><br>\nIn 2009, the game was Lunacy. Robots could only use special, slippery wheels, and they competed on a slippery surface of white, plasticy material called "regolith." The game was designed to simulate low gravity conditions in a lunar environment. To continue the theme, the gamepieces were small, light balls called "moonrocks." Robots started the game possessing up to 7 moonrocks, and many more were strewn throughout the field. Human players outside the field threw moonrocks at the trailers attached to each robot to score. Robots could also score on other robots by putting moonrocks into their opponents'' robots'' trailers.\n<br>\n<br>\nWe built our robot, Vortex, around possessing as many moonrocks as possible and being able to score them from a range. The main body had a sweeper that swept moonrocks into a spiral, which fed them up to the cannon. The cannon was aimed by a camera, which tracked the vision targets on the opposing alliance''s trailers. Our systems team also created a sophisticated traction control system with encoders to minimize slippage on the slick field. As the competition progressed we modified our cannon to allow us to quickly dump multiple moon rocks into opponents'' trailers at close range.\n<br>\n<br>\nAfter a tough build season, our first event was the Suffield Shakedown, hosted by Aces High team 176, which we won on an alliance with teams 195 and 126. After that event, we competed in the Connecticut Regional. Although we didn''t make it as far as we had in previous years, we won the Rockwell Automation Innovation in Control Award for our traction control system and autonomous mode.\n<br>\n<br>\nAs with every past year, we competed in Atlanta, Georgia, in the Championship.

The field was split into 3 sections by two 1-foot-tall bumps with tunnels in the middle, which allowed smaller robots to move between the sections without going over the bump. Robots were allowed to have kickers to kick the balls into 1 of the 2 goals per alliance at each corner of the field, for a total of 4 goals. Where the game stopped looking like soccer was at the end, where teams could climb up towers in the middle of the field for bonus points.\n\nWe knew we wanted our robot to be light, small, and maneuverable so we could quickly score as many soccer balls as possible, and so that we could move between sections of the field via the tunnels. In past years, we had always built our robot to do everything that it could. However, this year, because hanging was only worth 2 points, and soccer balls scored were worth 1 each, we decided that it made more sense to focus on scoring over hanging. Our robot, Striker, used a new drive system for us which gave each wheel a separate motor used window motors to turn the front and back wheels together. This allowed us to make tight turns and maneuver past defending robots to score. Though we built a pneumatic kicker that was quite effective, we mostly scored by "herding" or rolling soccer balls into the goals.\n\nThe UberBots had big plans for the 2010 season. Not only were we going to compete at 2 regionals for the first time ever, but we were planning to go for the Chairman''s Award. The Chairman''s award is the most prestigious Award given out by FIRST, to a team that spreads the message of FIRST, appreciation of science and technology, throughout their community. We had participated in many demos at schools and public places, and put together a video and an essay for the application.\n\nOur first regional was the WPI Regional. It was an early competition, so many teams, including us, were not in our prime. We only made it to the quarterfinals, where we were eliminated. However, we won the Chairman''s Award at WPI, even if we didn''t make it to the semifinals. We also won the Delphi Engineering Excellence Award for our robot''s elegant and simple design. The WPI Regional ended up going great, and it was good practice for our next event.\n\nThe Connecticut Regional was a fantastic event for the UberBots in 2010. We went undefeated throughout seeding and elimination matches, winning the the competition on an alliance with Team 102 (The Gearheads) and Team 383 (Brazilian Machine). Since our robot was offensive, we scored high and also won the Coopertition award, which calculated points based on both our score and our opponents'' score after each match. We had also helped numerous teams on other alliances during the competition, which is part of the Coopertition award. Because of our complex drive system which allowed us to switch between a swerve drive for tight turns, a rotated drive for kicking, and other modes, we were again awarded the Rockwell Innovation in Control Award.\n\nThe UberBots again went to Atlanta to compete in the Championship. The competition was intense, and we were eliminated in the quarter finals of our division. However, we still placed well overall because our robot was able to score many balls quickly.\n\nWith many of our members outgoing seniors, and the loss of our practice spaces on the horizon, the UberBots were looking forward to a challenging 2011 season...<br>'),

Though we thought we may have over-extended ourselves, everyone was supportive and helped make last-minute changes at competition. After our final seeding match we were ranked 34th, but teams 177 (Bobcat Robotics of South Windsor) and 176 (Aces High from Suffield and Windsor Locks High Schools) had faith in our team and chose us to be their alliance partner. With a lot of team work and a little luck, the UberBots and our alliance partners battled our way to the top to win the UTC New England regional.\n\nOur regional win that year qualified us for the 2006 national competition in Atlanta, and the long haul from Connecticut was definitely worth it. The memories created there will be with the team forever. The UberBots also competed in Battlecry @ WPI in June, and Bash @ the Beach in October, an offseason event that we participate in to this day. The Bash @ the Beach was a great competition for our team because it allowed us to work in a competitive yet low-key environment with the new year''s team, as it takes place in October. We allied with teams 190 (Gompei Herd of Worchester, MA) and 500 (Waterford''s Team USA) and placed second. We also received an "All Business" award commending "the team that is most serious about their robotics and their fun."\n'),

Our robot, which we named "Dynamite" included a 2-joint arm (with a "wrist" and "shoulder" motor and a gripper for a hand) which gave us great flexibility since we could both score by putting tubes on the rack and get points back by removing "spoiler" game pieces. Dynamite also had a set of deployable ramps long enough to hold two robots, which earned us bonus points. Dynamite also had hefty bumpers that allowed us to play defense if we needed to, and an autonomous mode with 16 different functions that allowed us to automatically raise Dynamite''s arm to different heights and other useful things.\n\nWe were able to "Rack ''n'' Roll" our way to the top, finishing as an alliance captain (in the top 8), and we ultimately won the UTC Connecticut Regional with team 195 (the CyberKnights of Southington) and team 558 (the RoboSquad from New Haven). For the second year in a row, we traveled to Atlanta to compete in the nationals, ending up in the Newton division again. This time, however, we were ranked third after the division seeding matches, and allied with  teams 1592 (the Bionic Tigers from Cocoa, FL) and 1816 (The Green Machine, all the way from Edina, Minnesota!). Our powerful alliance brought us all the way to the division finals. The UberBots continued to Einstein as the backup bot for Newton''s champion. After the Championship, we competed at Battlecry @ WPI, hosted by team 190, where we seeded 1st for the first time ever.<br>'),

Some examples are cron jobs, mass emailing, and ical file making.</li>\n<li>ajax<br/>\nThe ajax subdirectory contains all files called via ajax. They are mostly editing files, but also the calendar module uses this directory.</li>\n<li>includes<br/>\nThis subdirectory contains all files included in all other files. Include files mostly contain functions called by other scripts.</li>\n<li>logs<br/>\nThe logs subdirectory contains all logs site logs for administrative actions.</li>\n<li>media<br/>\nThe media subdirectory contains all media files for the photo gallery, files and documents, and other assorted media across the site.</li>\n<li>modules<br/>\nThe modules subdirectory contains all modules on the site.

The PHP files are integrated with the mySQL database, where they can get any content needed, as all of the website''s dynamic data and content is stored in that database. Formatting for the entire site is done in [url=http://w3.org/Style/CSS/]CSS[/url], to make a uniform style.\nPages and their content is also stored in the database. Content is output to the site in the form of [url=http://uberbots.org/o/about/our_website/advantages#modules]modules[/url], which are on [url=http://uberbots.org/o/about/our_website/advantages#pages]pages[/url]. A module is a predefined block of code that can be placed anywhere on the site to serve its purpose. This creates a "drag and drop" effect with code chunks, making it easy to put content on the site. Different modules serve different purposes. For example, the HTML module will output parsed HTML that the user input. The [url=http://bbcode.org]bbCode[/url] module will output parsed bbCode, a safe and simple way to provide formatting, commonly used on web forums.\nThe OmniPage system is also a skinnable engine. In order to change how the site looks, the website team simply has to create a new skin, or a different way of outputting content generated by modules. This gives the webmaster the ability to completely redesign the website without recoding it, or simply make a different way to view it, such as on mobile browsers. More information on skins can be found [url=http://uberbots.org/o/about/our_website/advantages#skins]here[/url].\nThe OmniPage system is also a secure system with dynamic and powerful user privileges. It is based off of phpBB''s permission system, which utilizes usergroups to make large scale permissions simple. More information on security can be found [url=http://uberbots.org/o/about/our_website/advantages#security]here[/url].\nAll in all, the OmniPage system is a very powerful website engine that was designed with simplicity and power in mind.\n\n[url=http://uberbots.org/o/about/our_website]About Our Website[/url]'),

(749, 'code', '[h1]Management Team Tutorial / Information[/h1]\nReturn to [ublink=o/resources/for_first_teams]FIRST Team Resources[/ublink]\n\nHey guys,\nNow that the year has started and this years management team starts to get some pieces of the puzzle into place. I wanted to take some time and record some general knowledge within a management team; along with some areas to remember as a new management team.\n\nWhen you are a brand new member to the management team it is difficult to understand what needs to be done and any deadlines you need to abide by. Hopefully this "post" will help future management teams get off the ground running!\n\n[h2]Mass Emails:[/h2]\nIf your team doesn''t know when an event is happening, how could any members possibly show up? Questions like this are exactly why the UberBots mass email system exists. When an event is about a month away, send a mass email letting parents and team members know what is going on. To learn more about our procedures for mass emails, along with other processes please [url=http://uberbots.org/o/Resources/For_FIRST_Teams/General_Procedures]click here.[/url]\n\n\n[h2]Events: [/h2]\nWhen planning for an event, their are a few key items to remember:\nMentors: You can''t have an event or a meeting without one.\nAttendance roster: Ask who can attend each event and at what times, otherwise you may be alone at an event (no fun)...\n\n[h2]Competitions:[/h2]\nBash at the Beach: Usually the beginning to mid October, make sure you get a gift basket ready prior to the competition. Use donated items or purchase items that coordinate with a theme. Around $75\nDon''t just focus on the drive team!! The rest of the team is just as crucial! (ie: scouting and spirit)\n\n[h2]Management Emails:[/h2]\nThese are critical to your success. If you can outline what event / fundraiser / meeting agenda''s in chronological order it makes it much easier to prepare and execute your "plan". Also, after each event send a summary email, and outline what the plan for the next week -> month will look like. \n\nHere is an example of inter management emails from right after Avon Day 2010:\n\n[size=85]"Hey guys,\n\nAvon day was a huge success. All throughout morning we had many interested parents whose younger children were very interested in the program.\nWe visited every booth and dropped off a brochure and a spoke about our program. In addition to the brochure we drove the 2008 robot past all of the booths using the inverter, which attracted quite a few people to our booth. \nWe presented on stage from 3-3:30 with a captive audience, Lauren, Justin, Matt H, and I spoke about FIRST, preseason, build season, awards, and how people can support our team.\nAs for team members in attendance we had 7 or 8 that stayed all day and a few who stopped by either in the morning or in the afternoon.\n\nMoving to our To Do list for this week... Here are a few keys things we need to focus on:\n1.

(750, 'code', '[h1]Management Team Tutorial / Information[/h1]\nReturn to [ublink=o/resources/for_first_teams]FIRST Team Resources[/ublink]\n\nHey guys,\nNow that the year has started and this years management team starts to get some pieces of the puzzle into place. I wanted to take some time and record some general knowledge within a management team; along with some areas to remember as a new management team.\n\nWhen you are a brand new member to the management team it is difficult to understand what needs to be done and any deadlines you need to abide by. Hopefully this "post" will help future management teams get off the ground running!\n\n[h2]Mass Emails:[/h2]\nIf your team doesn''t know when an event is happening, how could any members possibly show up? Questions like this are exactly why the UberBots mass email system exists. When an event is about a month away, send a mass email letting parents and team members know what is going on. To learn more about our procedures for mass emails, along with other processes please [url=http://uberbots.org/o/Resources/For_FIRST_Teams/General_Procedures]click here.[/url]\n\n\n[h2]Events: [/h2]\nWhen planning for an event, their are a few key items to remember:\nMentors: You can''t have an event or a meeting without one.\nAttendance roster: Ask who can attend each event and at what times, otherwise you may be alone at an event (no fun)...\nRemember permission slips, transportation (bus), and food.\n\n[h2]Competitions:[/h2]\nBash at the Beach: Usually the beginning to mid October, make sure you get a gift basket ready prior to the competition. Use donated items or purchase items that coordinate with a theme. Around $75\nDon''t just focus on the drive team!! The rest of the team is just as crucial! (ie: scouting and spirit)\n\n[h2]Management Emails:[/h2]\nThese are critical to your success. If you can outline what event / fundraiser / meeting agenda''s in chronological order it makes it much easier to prepare and execute your "plan". Also, after each event send a summary email, and outline what the plan for the next week -> month will look like. \n\nHere is an example of inter management emails from right after Avon Day 2010:\n\n[size=85]"Hey guys,\n\nAvon day was a huge success. All throughout morning we had many interested parents whose younger children were very interested in the program.\nWe visited every booth and dropped off a brochure and a spoke about our program. In addition to the brochure we drove the 2008 robot past all of the booths using the inverter, which attracted quite a few people to our booth. \nWe presented on stage from 3-3:30 with a captive audience, Lauren, Justin, Matt H, and I spoke about FIRST, preseason, build season, awards, and how people can support our team.\nAs for team members in attendance we had 7 or 8 that stayed all day and a few who stopped by either in the morning or in the afternoon.\n\nMoving to our To Do list for this week... Here are a few keys things we need to focus on:\n1. Management members attending the school activities fair TOMORROW during all four lunches.\n2.Entrance basket for B@B, what to include, where to get it from.\n3. Driver selection for B@B, hopefully Thursday night we can have a Driver Tryout and select 2 or 3 teams of drivers for the event.\n4.

Then we have six weeks (know as build season) to plan, build, and program a robot for our team. After build season, we compete in the Connecticut Regional (and The WPI Regional in 2010) and the international championship in Atlanta, GA (but in 2011, it''s going to be in St. Louis, MO). Outside of this "season" between Kickoff and the Championship, we do dozens of community demos and fundraisers to build awareness about science, technology, and robotics.\n<p style="clear:both;">\n\n<h2>How we do it</h2>\n<a href="http://www.utcfireandsecurity.com/" target="blank"><img src="/omni/media/sponsors/utcfireandsecurity.png" style="float:left;padding-right:5px;" alt="UTC Fire and Security, our main sponsor" title="UTC Fire and Security, our main sponsor"></a>Building our robot as well as building our team requires mechanical, programming, engineering, business, marketing, and leadership skills, which our members learn and develop on the team thanks to experienced team members and our adult leaders and mentors. We would be nowhere without our sponsors and mentors. The knowledge and support of our mentors are what makes the program so fun and educational. Most importantly, we would like to thank UTC Fire and Security who helps more than anybody to make our team possible. For more information, please visit our <a href="/o/about/our_mentors">Mentor</a> and <a href="/o/about/our_sponsors">Sponsor</a> pages.\n<p style="clear:both;">\n\n<h2>Why we do it</h2>\n<a href="http://usfirst.org/"><img src="http://www.uberbots.org/omni/media/firstlogo.gif" alt="FIRST, our mother organization" title="FIRST, our mother organization" style="float:right;padding-left:5px;"></a>\nWe spend all this time building a robot as well as our team to work to spread the ideals of FIRST around our community. We work to help make true FIRST''s vision: <em>"To transform our culture by creating a world where science and technology are celebrated."</em> In addition, we work <em>"to inspire young people to be science and technology leaders"</em> through exposure to science, technology, and gracious professionalism which we accomplish both within the team and outside it through our numerous community demos and fundraisers.

His goal was to expose students of all ages to science and technology in such a way that they would become inspired to become scientists and engineers in the future.  Kamen worked with MIT mechanical engineering professor Dr. Woodie Flowers to create the first ever FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) at a New Hampshire high school in 1992.  From that point on, FIRST has grown to be one the largest robotics competitions in the world.  The program has over 250,000 students working on 22,600 robots with the assistance of over 68,000 mentors and 33,000 volunteers from all disciplines such as engineering, fund raising, and team leadership (project value, usfirst.org).  The program also expands beyond US borders to over ten countries like Israel, Brazil, Japan, and even Australia.[/color]\n\n[color=#002699][i]FIRST[/i] have four main levels of competition: Junior [i]FIRST[/i] Lego League for ages 6-9 (JFLL), [i]FIRST[/i] Lego League for students in grades 4-8(FLL), [i]FIRST[/i] Tech Challenge for students grades 9-12 (FTC), and The [i]FIRST[/i] Robotics Competition, also for high school aged students (FRC).  The [Uml][/Uml]berBots compete on the FRC level, which is also the largest level of competition.  Around the first or second week in January, [i]FIRST[/i] releases a challenge for FRC students as well as a rule book with very specific details concerning the size of the robot, details about game play, and more.  Students then have six weeks to design, build, and program their robots in order to be shipped by a certain date.  After ship date, students are not allowed to touch their robot until competition, where they compete on an international level.  The winners of each of these "regional" events moves onto the Championship tournament in St. Louis, Missouri.  This allows FRC to always been exciting, for no two games are ever the same.  Starting from the end of the Championship event, the FRC Game Design Committee (GDC) starts working hard on the next game so it''s almost perfect by kickoff (there are always constant updates being made, even between regional competitions).[/color]'),

Though we thought we may have over-extended ourselves, everyone was supportive and helped make last-minute changes at competition. After our final seeding match we were ranked 34th, but teams 177 (Bobcat Robotics of South Windsor) and 176 (Aces High from Suffield and Windsor Locks High Schools) had faith in our team and chose us to be their alliance partner. With a lot of team work and a little luck, the UberBots and our alliance partners battled our way to the top to win the UTC New England regional.\n\nOur regional win that year qualified us for the 2006 national competition in Atlanta, and the long haul from Connecticut was definitely worth it. The memories created there will be with the team forever. The UberBots also competed in Battlecry @ WPI in June, and Bash @ the Beach in October, an offseason event that we participate in to this day. The Bash @ the Beach was a great competition for our team because it allowed us to work in a competitive yet low-key environment with the new year''s team, as it takes place in October. We allied with teams 190 (Gompei Herd of Worchester, MA) and 500 (Waterford''s Team USA) and placed second. We also received an "All Business" award commending "the team that is most serious about their robotics and their fun."\n'),

Our robot, which we named "Dynamite" included a 2-joint arm (with a "wrist" and "shoulder" motor and a gripper for a hand) which gave us great flexibility since we could both score by putting tubes on the rack and get points back by removing "spoiler" game pieces. Dynamite also had a set of deployable ramps long enough to hold two robots, which earned us bonus points. Dynamite also had hefty bumpers that allowed us to play defense if we needed to, and an autonomous mode with 16 different functions that allowed us to automatically raise Dynamite''s arm to different heights and other useful things.\n\nWe were able to "Rack ''n'' Roll" our way to the top, finishing as an alliance captain (in the top 8), and we ultimately won the UTC Connecticut Regional with team 195 (the CyberKnights of Southington) and team 558 (the RoboSquad from New Haven). For the second year in a row, we traveled to Atlanta to compete in the nationals, ending up in the Newton division again. This time, however, we were ranked third after the division seeding matches, and allied with  teams 1592 (the Bionic Tigers from Cocoa, FL) and 1816 (The Green Machine, all the way from Edina, Minnesota!). Our powerful alliance brought us all the way to the division finals. The UberBots continued to Einstein as the backup bot for Newton''s champion. After the Championship, we competed at Battlecry @ WPI, hosted by team 190, where we seeded 1st for the first time ever.<br>'),

Teams could also earn points by "hurdling" the track balls over the 9-foot "overpass" in the middle of the field. The field was divided the long way down the center to give it a race-track feel. We responded to these aspects of the game in many ways as we designed and built our robot that year, Lightning.\n<br>\n<br>\nWe gave Lightning a two-speed transmission so that we could have both the speed to make it around the track and the precision to pick up the large track balls. To pick up and handle the large balls, we gave Lightning a 2-joint arm and a claw that could expand to wrap around the ball, then contract to keep possession of the ball as we moved around the field.\n<br>\n<br>\nWe built a second robot and a replica of the field in the space donated to us by Reflexite so that we could practice driving even after we had shipped our robot off after build season. We attended the Suffield Shakedown 2008 Scrimmage hosted by Team 176, Aces High. The competition was good practice for the new 2008 season''s team, and it let us see how other teams had tackled the challenges of the game. Allied with team 230 (the Gaelhawks) and team 1784 (the Litchbots), we won the scrimmage undefeated. Our team was also successful off the field, winning the spirit award for the first time ever. We were looking forward to how we would fare at the Connecticut regional.\n<br>\n<br>\nAt the Connecticut Regional, we won all our qualification matches, allied with numerous other great teams, and placed first in seeding among the 62 teams at the competition. This was a mark of progress for our team, as only two years ago we had had to fix our robot after every match. For the elimination matches, we allied with team 175 (Buzz Robotics) and team 716 (the Who''s-C-Teks). Through the quarterfinals, semifinals, and finals, our alliance went undefeated, winning the Connecticut Regional. During the award ceremony, we were honored with the Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers Entrepreneurship Award, recognizing our work in the community.\n<br>\n<br>\nIn 2008, the UberBots also competed in the Championship in Atlanta. In qualification, we achieved a 6-1 record, becoming the captains of the third alliance. We invited teams 1024 and 177 to be part of our alliance, creating a well-rounded team that could handle any situation on the field. Our alliance won in the quarterfinals and the semifinals, leading us to the finals where we faced another strong alliance captained by team 987. With past world champions and multiple regional winners on both sides, the competition was intense, but our alliance pulled through to become the champions of the Archimedes field. We advanced to the Einstein field, where we played teams who had advanced from other divisions. Our alliance faced even tougher competition there, but we became international semifinalists. 2008 was a great year for the UberBots. We went undefeated in all our regionals, and advanced all the way to the world semifinals in Atlanta.\n<br>\n<h2 style="color:#bf0000; font-weight:bold">2008-2009: Absolute Lunacy</h2><div id="infoBox" style="float:right;"><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyER3MrNBZQ" target="blank" title="2009-Lunacy" alt="Lunacy"><image src="/omni/media/history/09game.jpg" style="  height:auto; width:160px; float:right;"></a><br><img src="/omni/media/history/09bot.jpg" title="Vortex" alt="Vortex" style=" height:200px; width:automatic;"></div><br>\nIn 2009, the game was Lunacy. Robots could only use special, slippery wheels, and they competed on a slippery surface of white, plasticy material called "regolith." The game was designed to simulate low gravity conditions in a lunar environment. To continue the theme, the gamepieces were small, light balls called "moonrocks." Robots started the game possessing up to 7 moonrocks, and many more were strewn throughout the field. Human players outside the field threw moonrocks at the trailers attached to each robot to score. Robots could also score on other robots by putting moonrocks into their opponents'' robots'' trailers.\n<br>\n<br>\nWe built our robot, Vortex, around possessing as many moonrocks as possible and being able to score them from a range. The main body had a sweeper that swept moonrocks into a spiral, which fed them up to the cannon. The cannon was aimed by a camera, which tracked the vision targets on the opposing alliance''s trailers. Our systems team also created a sophisticated traction control system with encoders to minimize slippage on the slick field. As the competition progressed we modified our cannon to allow us to quickly dump multiple moon rocks into opponents'' trailers at close range.\n<br>\n<br>\nAfter a tough build season, our first event was the Suffield Shakedown, hosted by Aces High team 176, which we won on an alliance with teams 195 and 126. After that event, we competed in the Connecticut Regional. Although we didn''t make it as far as we had in previous years, we won the Rockwell Automation Innovation in Control Award for our traction control system and autonomous mode.\n<br>\n<br>\nAs with every past year, we competed in Atlanta, Georgia, in the Championship. The competition was great and a lot of fun, and we managed to make it to the quarterfinals on the Galileo Field, where we were eliminated by the alliance that went on to win the entire Championship.'),

The field was split into 3 sections by two 1-foot-tall bumps with tunnels in the middle, which allowed smaller robots to move between the sections without going over the bump. Robots were allowed to have kickers to kick the balls into 1 of the 2 goals per alliance at each corner of the field, for a total of 4 goals. Where the game stopped looking like soccer was at the end, where teams could climb up towers in the middle of the field for bonus points.\n\nWe knew we wanted our robot to be light, small, and maneuverable so we could quickly score as many soccer balls as possible, and so that we could move between sections of the field via the tunnels. In past years, we had always built our robot to do everything that it could. However, this year, because hanging was only worth 2 points, and soccer balls scored were worth 1 each, we decided that it made more sense to focus on scoring over hanging. Our robot, Striker, used a new drive system for us which gave each wheel a separate motor used window motors to turn the front and back wheels together. This allowed us to make tight turns and maneuver past defending robots to score. Though we built a pneumatic kicker that was quite effective, we mostly scored by "herding" or rolling soccer balls into the goals.\n\nThe UberBots had big plans for the 2010 season. Not only were we going to compete at 2 regionals for the first time ever, but we were planning to go for the Chairman''s Award. The Chairman''s award is the most prestigious Award given out by FIRST, to a team that spreads the message of FIRST, appreciation of science and technology, throughout their community. We had participated in many demos at schools and public places, and put together a video and an essay for the application.\n\nOur first regional was the WPI Regional. It was an early competition, so many teams, including us, were not in our prime. We only made it to the quarterfinals, where we were eliminated. However, we won the Chairman''s Award at WPI, even if we didn''t make it to the semifinals. We also won the Delphi Engineering Excellence Award for our robot''s elegant and simple design. The WPI Regional ended up going great, and it was good practice for our next event.\n\nThe Connecticut Regional was a fantastic event for the UberBots in 2010. We went undefeated throughout seeding and elimination matches, winning the the competition on an alliance with Team 102 (The Gearheads) and Team 383 (Brazilian Machine). Since our robot was offensive, we scored high and also won the Coopertition award, which calculated points based on both our score and our opponents'' score after each match. We had also helped numerous teams on other alliances during the competition, which is part of the Coopertition award. Because of our complex drive system which allowed us to switch between a swerve drive for tight turns, a rotated drive for kicking, and other modes, we were again awarded the Rockwell Innovation in Control Award.\n\nThe UberBots again went to Atlanta to compete in the Championship. The competition was intense, and we were eliminated in the quarter finals of our division. However, we still placed well overall because our robot was able to score many balls quickly.\n\nWith many of our members outgoing seniors, and the loss of our practice spaces on the horizon, the UberBots were looking forward to a challenging 2011 season...<br>'),

Robots could only use special, slippery wheels, and they competed on a slippery surface of white, plasticy material called "regolith." The game was designed to simulate low gravity conditions in a lunar environment. To continue the theme, the gamepieces were small, light balls called "moonrocks." Robots started the game possessing up to 7 moonrocks, and many more were strewn throughout the field. Human players outside the field threw moonrocks at the trailers attached to each robot to score. Robots could also score on other robots by putting moonrocks into their opponents'' robots'' trailers.\n<br>\n<br>\nWe built our robot, Vortex, around possessing as many moonrocks as possible and being able to score them from a range. The main body had a sweeper that swept moonrocks into a spiral, which fed them up to the cannon. The cannon was aimed by a camera, which tracked the vision targets on the opposing alliance''s trailers. Our systems team also created a sophisticated traction control system with encoders to minimize slippage on the slick field. As the competition progressed we modified our cannon to allow us to quickly dump multiple moon rocks into opponents'' trailers at close range.\n<br>\n<br>\nAfter a tough build season, our first event was the Suffield Shakedown, hosted by Aces High team 176, which we won on an alliance with teams 195 and 126. After that event, we competed in the Connecticut Regional. Although we didn''t make it as far as we had in previous years, we won the Rockwell Automation Innovation in Control Award for our traction control system and autonomous mode.\n<br>\n<br>\nAs with every past year, we competed in Atlanta, Georgia, in the Championship.

Though we thought we may have over-extended ourselves, everyone was supportive and helped make last-minute changes at competition. After our final seeding match we were ranked 34th, but teams 177 (Bobcat Robotics of South Windsor) and 176 (Aces High from Suffield and Windsor Locks High Schools) had faith in our team and chose us to be their alliance partner. With a lot of team work and a little luck, the UberBots and our alliance partners battled our way to the top to win the UTC New England regional.\n\nOur regional win that year qualified us for the 2006 national competition in Atlanta, and the long haul from Connecticut was definitely worth it. The memories created there will be with the team forever. The UberBots also competed in Battlecry @ WPI in June, and Bash @ the Beach in October, an offseason event that we participate in to this day. The Bash @ the Beach was a great competition for our team because it allowed us to work in a competitive yet low-key environment with the new year''s team, as it takes place in October. We allied with teams 190 (Gompei Herd of Worchester, MA) and 500 (Waterford''s Team USA) and placed second.

Our robot, which we named "Dynamite" included a 2-joint arm (with a "wrist" and "shoulder" motor and a gripper for a hand) which gave us great flexibility since we could both score by putting tubes on the rack and get points back by removing "spoiler" game pieces. Dynamite also had a set of deployable ramps long enough to hold two robots, which earned us bonus points. Dynamite also had hefty bumpers that allowed us to play defense if we needed to, and an autonomous mode with 16 different functions that allowed us to automatically raise Dynamite''s arm to different heights and other useful things.\n\nWe were able to "Rack ''n'' Roll" our way to the top, finishing as an alliance captain (in the top 8), and we ultimately won the UTC Connecticut Regional with team 195 (the CyberKnights of Southington) and team 558 (the RoboSquad from New Haven). For the second year in a row, we traveled to Atlanta to compete in the nationals, ending up in the Newton division again. This time, however, we were ranked third after the division seeding matches, and allied with  teams 1592 (the Bionic Tigers from Cocoa, FL) and 1816 (The Green Machine, all the way from Edina, Minnesota!).

Our robot, Striker, used a new drive system for us which gave each wheel a separate motor used window motors to turn the front and back wheels together.

Teams could also earn points by "hurdling" the track balls over the 9-foot "overpass" in the middle of the field. The field was divided the long way down the center to give it a race-track feel. We responded to these aspects of the game in many ways as we designed and built our robot that year, Lightning.\n<br>\n<br>\nWe gave Lightning a two-speed transmission so that we could have both the speed to make it around the track and the precision to pick up the large track balls. To pick up and handle the large balls, we gave Lightning a 2-joint arm and a claw that could expand to wrap around the ball, then contract to keep possession of the ball as we moved around the field.\n<br>\n<br>\nWe built a second robot and a replica of the field in the space donated to us by Reflexite so that we could practice driving even after we had shipped our robot off after build season. We attended the Suffield Shakedown 2008 Scrimmage hosted by Team 176, Aces High. The competition was good practice for the new 2008 season''s team, and it let us see how other teams had tackled the challenges of the game. Allied with team 230 (the Gaelhawks) and team 1784 (the Litchbots), we won the scrimmage undefeated. Our team was also successful off the field, winning the spirit award for the first time ever.

This was a mark of progress for our team, as only two years ago we had had to fix our robot after every match. For the elimination matches, we allied with team 175 (Buzz Robotics) and team 716 (the Who''s-C-Teks).

During the award ceremony, we were honored with the Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers Entrepreneurship Award, recognizing our work in the community.\n<br>\n<br>\nIn 2008, the UberBots also competed in the Championship in Atlanta. In qualification, we achieved a 6-1 record, becoming the captains of the third alliance. We invited teams 1024 and 177 to be part of our alliance, creating a well-rounded team that could handle any situation on the field. Our alliance won in the quarterfinals and the semifinals, leading us to the finals where we faced another strong alliance captained by team 987. With past world champions and multiple regional winners on both sides, the competition was intense, but our alliance pulled through to become the champions of the Archimedes field. We advanced to the Einstein field, where we played teams who had advanced from other divisions. Our alliance faced even tougher competition there, but we became international semifinalists. 2008 was a great year for the UberBots.

This was a mark of progress for our team, as only two years ago we had had to fix our robot after every match. For the elimination matches, we allied with team 175 (Buzz Robotics) and team 716 (the Who''s-C-Teks). Through the quarterfinals, semifinals, and finals, our alliance went undefeated, winning the Connecticut Regional. During the award ceremony, we were honored with the Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers Entrepreneurship Award, recognizing our work in the community.\n<br>\n<br>\nIn 2008, the UberBots also competed in the Championship in Atlanta. In qualification, we achieved a 6-1 record, becoming the captains of the third alliance. We invited teams 1024 and 177 to be part of our alliance, creating a well-rounded team that could handle any situation on the field. Our alliance won in the quarterfinals and the semifinals, leading us to the finals where we faced another strong alliance captained by team 987. With past world champions and multiple regional winners on both sides, the competition was intense, but our alliance pulled through to become the champions of the Archimedes field. We advanced to the Einstein field, where we played teams who had advanced from other divisions. Our alliance faced even tougher competition there, but we became international semifinalists. 2008 was a great year for the UberBots. We went undefeated in all our regionals, and advanced all the way to the world semifinals in Atlanta.\n<br>\n<h2 style="color:#bf0000; font-weight:bold">2008-2009: Absolute Lunacy</h2><div class="infoBox" style="float:right;"><p>2008-2009</p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyER3MrNBZQ" target="blank" title="2009-Lunacy" alt="Lunacy"><img src="/omni/media/history/09game.jpg" style="height:auto; width:160px; float:right;"></a><br><img src="/omni/media/history/09bot.jpg" title="Vortex" alt="Vortex" style=" height:200px; width:automatic;"><br>\n<b>Game:</b> Lunacy<br>\n<br>\n<b>Awards:</b>2009 Suffield Shakedown Champions (thanks 195 and 126)\n<br>\n-2009 Hartford Regional Rockwell Automation Innovation in Control Award </div><br>\nIn 2009, the game was Lunacy. Robots could only use special, slippery wheels, and they competed on a slippery surface of white, plasticy material called "regolith." The game was designed to simulate low gravity conditions in a lunar environment. To continue the theme, the gamepieces were small, light balls called "moonrocks." Robots started the game possessing up to 7 moonrocks, and many more were strewn throughout the field. Human players outside the field threw moonrocks at the trailers attached to each robot to score. Robots could also score on other robots by putting moonrocks into their opponents'' robots'' trailers.\n<br>\n<br>\nWe built our robot, Vortex, around possessing as many moonrocks as possible and being able to score them from a range. The main body had a sweeper that swept moonrocks into a spiral, which fed them up to the cannon. The cannon was aimed by a camera, which tracked the vision targets on the opposing alliance''s trailers. Our systems team also created a sophisticated traction control system with encoders to minimize slippage on the slick field. As the competition progressed we modified our cannon to allow us to quickly dump multiple moon rocks into opponents'' trailers at close range.\n<br>\n<br>\nAfter a tough build season, our first event was the Suffield Shakedown, hosted by Aces High team 176, which we won on an alliance with teams 195 and 126. After that event, we competed in the Connecticut Regional. Although we didn''t make it as far as we had in previous years, we won the Rockwell Automation Innovation in Control Award for our traction control system and autonomous mode.\n<br>\n<br>\nAs with every past year, we competed in Atlanta, Georgia, in the Championship. The competition was great and a lot of fun, and we managed to make it to the quarterfinals on the Galileo Field, where we were eliminated by the alliance that went on to win the entire Championship.'),

The field was split into 3 sections by two 1-foot-tall bumps with tunnels in the middle, which allowed smaller robots to move between the sections without going over the bump. Robots were allowed to have kickers to kick the balls into 1 of the 2 goals per alliance at each corner of the field, for a total of 4 goals. Where the game stopped looking like soccer was at the end, where teams could climb up towers in the middle of the field for bonus points.\n\nWe knew we wanted our robot to be light, small, and maneuverable so we could quickly score as many soccer balls as possible, and so that we could move between sections of the field via the tunnels. In past years, we had always built our robot to do everything that it could. However, this year, because hanging was only worth 2 points, and soccer balls scored were worth 1 each, we decided that it made more sense to focus on scoring over hanging. Our robot, Striker, used a new drive system for us which gave each wheel a separate motor used window motors to turn the front and back wheels together. This allowed us to make tight turns and maneuver past defending robots to score. Though we built a pneumatic kicker that was quite effective, we mostly scored by "herding" or rolling soccer balls into the goals.\n\nThe UberBots had big plans for the 2010 season. Not only were we going to compete at 2 regionals for the first time ever, but we were planning to go for the Chairman''s Award. The Chairman''s award is the most prestigious Award given out by FIRST, to a team that spreads the message of FIRST, appreciation of science and technology, throughout their community. We had participated in many demos at schools and public places, and put together a video and an essay for the application.\n\nOur first regional was the WPI Regional. It was an early competition, so many teams, including us, were not in our prime. We only made it to the quarterfinals, where we were eliminated. However, we won the Chairman''s Award at WPI, even if we didn''t make it to the semifinals. We also won the Delphi Engineering Excellence Award for our robot''s elegant and simple design. The WPI Regional ended up going great, and it was good practice for our next event.\n\nThe Connecticut Regional was a fantastic event for the UberBots in 2010. We went undefeated throughout seeding and elimination matches, winning the the competition on an alliance with Team 102 (The Gearheads) and Team 383 (Brazilian Machine). Since our robot was offensive, we scored high and also won the Coopertition award, which calculated points based on both our score and our opponents'' score after each match. We had also helped numerous teams on other alliances during the competition, which is part of the Coopertition award. Because of our complex drive system which allowed us to switch between a swerve drive for tight turns, a rotated drive for kicking, and other modes, we were again awarded the Rockwell Innovation in Control Award.\n\nThe UberBots again went to Atlanta to compete in the Championship. The competition was intense, and we were eliminated in the quarter finals of our division. However, we still placed well overall because our robot was able to score many balls quickly.\n\nWith many of our members outgoing seniors, and the loss of our practice spaces on the horizon, the UberBots were looking forward to a challenging 2011 season...<br>'),

After our final seeding match we were ranked 34th, but teams 177 (Bobcat Robotics of South Windsor) and 176 (Aces High from Suffield and Windsor Locks High Schools) had faith in our team and chose us to be their alliance partner. With a lot of team work and a little luck, the UberBots and our alliance partners battled our way to the top to win the UTC New England regional.\n\nOur regional win that year qualified us for the 2006 national competition in Atlanta, and the long haul from Connecticut was definitely worth it. The memories created there will be with the team forever. The UberBots also competed in Battlecry @ WPI in June, and Bash @ the Beach in October, an offseason event that we participate in to this day. The Bash @ the Beach was a great competition for our team because it allowed us to work in a competitive yet low-key environment with the new year''s team, as it takes place in October. We allied with teams 190 (Gompei Herd of Worchester, MA) and 500 (Waterford''s Team USA) and placed second. We also received an "All Business" award commending "the team that is most serious about their robotics and their fun."\n'),

Our robot, which we named "Dynamite" included a 2-joint arm (with a "wrist" and "shoulder" motor and a gripper for a hand) which gave us great flexibility since we could both score by putting tubes on the rack and get points back by removing "spoiler" game pieces. Dynamite also had a set of deployable ramps long enough to hold two robots, which earned us bonus points. Dynamite also had hefty bumpers that allowed us to play defense if we needed to, and an autonomous mode with 16 different functions that allowed us to automatically raise Dynamite''s arm to different heights and other useful things.\n\nWe were able to "Rack ''n'' Roll" our way to the top, finishing as an alliance captain (in the top 8), and we ultimately won the UTC Connecticut Regional with team 195 (the CyberKnights of Southington) and team 558 (the RoboSquad from New Haven). For the second year in a row, we traveled to Atlanta to compete in the nationals, ending up in the Newton division again. This time, however, we were ranked third after the division seeding matches, and allied with  teams 1592 (the Bionic Tigers from Cocoa, FL) and 1816 (The Green Machine, all the way from Edina, Minnesota!). Our powerful alliance brought us all the way to the division finals. The UberBots continued to Einstein as the backup bot for Newton''s champion. After the Championship, we competed at Battlecry @ WPI, hosted by team 190, where we seeded 1st for the first time ever.<br>'),

Invitational Friendliest Team</div>\n<br>\nThe game in 2008 was Overdrive, a fast-paced game where teams could score points either by carrying one of two game pieces per alliance, 40" diameter track balls, around the the field, or simply by making laps. Teams could also earn points by "hurdling" the track balls over the 9-foot "overpass" in the middle of the field. The field was divided the long way down the center to give it a race-track feel. We responded to these aspects of the game in many ways as we designed and built our robot that year, Lightning.\n<br>\n<br>\nWe gave Lightning a two-speed transmission so that we could have both the speed to make it around the track and the precision to pick up the large track balls. To pick up and handle the large balls, we gave Lightning a 2-joint arm and a claw that could expand to wrap around the ball, then contract to keep possession of the ball as we moved around the field.\n<br>\n<br>\nWe built a second robot and a replica of the field in the space donated to us by Reflexite so that we could practice driving even after we had shipped our robot off after build season. We attended the Suffield Shakedown 2008 Scrimmage hosted by Team 176, Aces High. The competition was good practice for the new 2008 season''s team, and it let us see how other teams had tackled the challenges of the game. Allied with team 230 (the Gaelhawks) and team 1784 (the Litchbots), we won the scrimmage undefeated. Our team was also successful off the field, winning the spirit award for the first time ever. We were looking forward to how we would fare at the Connecticut regional.\n<br>\n<br>\nAt the Connecticut Regional, we won all our qualification matches, allied with numerous other great teams, and placed first in seeding among the 62 teams at the competition. This was a mark of progress for our team, as only two years ago we had had to fix our robot after every match. For the elimination matches, we allied with team 175 (Buzz Robotics) and team 716 (the Who''s-C-Teks). Through the quarterfinals, semifinals, and finals, our alliance went undefeated, winning the Connecticut Regional. During the award ceremony, we were honored with the Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers Entrepreneurship Award, recognizing our work in the community.\n<br>\n<br>\nIn 2008, the UberBots also competed in the Championship in Atlanta. In qualification, we achieved a 6-1 record, becoming the captains of the third alliance. We invited teams 1024 and 177 to be part of our alliance, creating a well-rounded team that could handle any situation on the field. Our alliance won in the quarterfinals and the semifinals, leading us to the finals where we faced another strong alliance captained by team 987. With past world champions and multiple regional winners on both sides, the competition was intense, but our alliance pulled through to become the champions of the Archimedes field. We advanced to the Einstein field, where we played teams who had advanced from other divisions. Our alliance faced even tougher competition there, but we became international semifinalists. 2008 was a great year for the UberBots. We went undefeated in all our regionals, and advanced all the way to the world semifinals in Atlanta.\n<br>\n<h2 style="color:#bf0000; font-weight:bold">2008-2009: Absolute Lunacy</h2><div class="infoBox" style="float:right;"><p>2008-2009</p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyER3MrNBZQ" target="blank" title="2009-Lunacy" alt="Lunacy"><img src="/omni/media/history/09game.jpg" style="height:auto; width:160px;"></a><br><img src="/omni/media/history/09bot.jpg" title="Vortex" alt="Vortex" style=" height:200px; width:automatic;"><br>\n<b>Game:</b> Lunacy<br>\n<br>\n<b>Awards:</b>2009 Suffield Shakedown Champions (thanks 195 and 126)\n<br>\n-2009 Hartford Regional Rockwell Automation Innovation in Control Award </div><br>\nIn 2009, the game was Lunacy. Robots could only use special, slippery wheels, and they competed on a slippery surface of white, plasticy material called "regolith." The game was designed to simulate low gravity conditions in a lunar environment. To continue the theme, the gamepieces were small, light balls called "moonrocks." Robots started the game possessing up to 7 moonrocks, and many more were strewn throughout the field. Human players outside the field threw moonrocks at the trailers attached to each robot to score. Robots could also score on other robots by putting moonrocks into their opponents'' robots'' trailers.\n<br>\n<br>\nWe built our robot, Vortex, around possessing as many moonrocks as possible and being able to score them from a range. The main body had a sweeper that swept moonrocks into a spiral, which fed them up to the cannon. The cannon was aimed by a camera, which tracked the vision targets on the opposing alliance''s trailers. Our systems team also created a sophisticated traction control system with encoders to minimize slippage on the slick field. As the competition progressed we modified our cannon to allow us to quickly dump multiple moon rocks into opponents'' trailers at close range.\n<br>\n<br>\nAfter a tough build season, our first event was the Suffield Shakedown, hosted by Aces High team 176, which we won on an alliance with teams 195 and 126. After that event, we competed in the Connecticut Regional.

The field was split into 3 sections by two 1-foot-tall bumps with tunnels in the middle, which allowed smaller robots to move between the sections without going over the bump. Robots were allowed to have kickers to kick the balls into 1 of the 2 goals per alliance at each corner of the field, for a total of 4 goals. Where the game stopped looking like soccer was at the end, where teams could climb up towers in the middle of the field for bonus points.\n\nWe knew we wanted our robot to be light, small, and maneuverable so we could quickly score as many soccer balls as possible, and so that we could move between sections of the field via the tunnels. In past years, we had always built our robot to do everything that it could. However, this year, because hanging was only worth 2 points, and soccer balls scored were worth 1 each, we decided that it made more sense to focus on scoring over hanging. Our robot, Striker, used a new drive system for us which gave each wheel a separate motor used window motors to turn the front and back wheels together. This allowed us to make tight turns and maneuver past defending robots to score. Though we built a pneumatic kicker that was quite effective, we mostly scored by "herding" or rolling soccer balls into the goals.\n\nThe UberBots had big plans for the 2010 season. Not only were we going to compete at 2 regionals for the first time ever, but we were planning to go for the Chairman''s Award. The Chairman''s award is the most prestigious Award given out by FIRST, to a team that spreads the message of FIRST, appreciation of science and technology, throughout their community. We had participated in many demos at schools and public places, and put together a video and an essay for the application.\n\nOur first regional was the WPI Regional. It was an early competition, so many teams, including us, were not in our prime. We only made it to the quarterfinals, where we were eliminated. However, we won the Chairman''s Award at WPI, even if we didn''t make it to the semifinals. We also won the Delphi Engineering Excellence Award for our robot''s elegant and simple design. The WPI Regional ended up going great, and it was good practice for our next event.\n\nThe Connecticut Regional was a fantastic event for the UberBots in 2010. We went undefeated throughout seeding and elimination matches, winning the the competition on an alliance with Team 102 (The Gearheads) and Team 383 (Brazilian Machine). Since our robot was offensive, we scored high and also won the Coopertition award, which calculated points based on both our score and our opponents'' score after each match. We had also helped numerous teams on other alliances during the competition, which is part of the Coopertition award. Because of our complex drive system which allowed us to switch between a swerve drive for tight turns, a rotated drive for kicking, and other modes, we were again awarded the Rockwell Innovation in Control Award.\n\nThe UberBots again went to Atlanta to compete in the Championship. The competition was intense, and we were eliminated in the quarter finals of our division. However, we still placed well overall because our robot was able to score many balls quickly.\n\nWith many of our members outgoing seniors, and the loss of our practice spaces on the horizon, the UberBots were looking forward to a challenging 2011 season...<br>');

Though we thought we may have over-extended ourselves, everyone was supportive and helped make last-minute changes at competition. After our final seeding match we were ranked 34th, but teams 177 (Bobcat Robotics of South Windsor) and 176 (Aces High from Suffield and Windsor Locks High Schools) had faith in our team and chose us to be their alliance partner. With a lot of team work and a little luck, the UberBots and our alliance partners battled our way to the top to win the UTC New England regional.\n\nOur regional win that year qualified us for the 2006 national competition in Atlanta, and the long haul from Connecticut was definitely worth it. The memories created there will be with the team forever. The UberBots also competed in Battlecry @ WPI in June, and Bash @ the Beach in October, an offseason event that we participate in to this day. The Bash @ the Beach was a great competition for our team because it allowed us to work in a competitive yet low-key environment with the new year''s team, as it takes place in October. We allied with teams 190 (Gompei Herd of Worchester, MA) and 500 (Waterford''s Team USA) and placed second. We also received an "All Business" award commending "the team that is most serious about their robotics and their fun."\n'),

Our robot, which we named "Dynamite" included a 2-joint arm (with a "wrist" and "shoulder" motor and a gripper for a hand) which gave us great flexibility since we could both score by putting tubes on the rack and get points back by removing "spoiler" game pieces. Dynamite also had a set of deployable ramps long enough to hold two robots, which earned us bonus points. Dynamite also had hefty bumpers that allowed us to play defense if we needed to, and an autonomous mode with 16 different functions that allowed us to automatically raise Dynamite''s arm to different heights and other useful things.\n\nWe were able to "Rack ''n'' Roll" our way to the top, finishing as an alliance captain (in the top 8), and we ultimately won the UTC Connecticut Regional with team 195 (the CyberKnights of Southington) and team 558 (the RoboSquad from New Haven). For the second year in a row, we traveled to Atlanta to compete in the nationals, ending up in the Newton division again. This time, however, we were ranked third after the division seeding matches, and allied with  teams 1592 (the Bionic Tigers from Cocoa, FL) and 1816 (The Green Machine, all the way from Edina, Minnesota!). Our powerful alliance brought us all the way to the division finals. The UberBots continued to Einstein as the backup bot for Newton''s champion. After the Championship, we competed at Battlecry @ WPI, hosted by team 190, where we seeded 1st for the first time ever.<br>'),

Teams could also earn points by "hurdling" the track balls over the 9-foot "overpass" in the middle of the field. The field was divided the long way down the center to give it a race-track feel. We responded to these aspects of the game in many ways as we designed and built our robot that year, Lightning.\n<br>\n<br>\nWe gave Lightning a two-speed transmission so that we could have both the speed to make it around the track and the precision to pick up the large track balls. To pick up and handle the large balls, we gave Lightning a 2-joint arm and a claw that could expand to wrap around the ball, then contract to keep possession of the ball as we moved around the field.\n<br>\n<br>\nWe built a second robot and a replica of the field in the space donated to us by Reflexite so that we could practice driving even after we had shipped our robot off after build season. We attended the Suffield Shakedown 2008 Scrimmage hosted by Team 176, Aces High. The competition was good practice for the new 2008 season''s team, and it let us see how other teams had tackled the challenges of the game. Allied with team 230 (the Gaelhawks) and team 1784 (the Litchbots), we won the scrimmage undefeated. Our team was also successful off the field, winning the spirit award for the first time ever.

This was a mark of progress for our team, as only two years ago we had had to fix our robot after every match. For the elimination matches, we allied with team 175 (Buzz Robotics) and team 716 (the Who''s-C-Teks).

During the award ceremony, we were honored with the Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers Entrepreneurship Award, recognizing our work in the community.\n<br>\n<br>\nIn 2008, the UberBots also competed in the Championship in Atlanta. In qualification, we achieved a 6-1 record, becoming the captains of the third alliance. We invited teams 1024 and 177 to be part of our alliance, creating a well-rounded team that could handle any situation on the field. Our alliance won in the quarterfinals and the semifinals, leading us to the finals where we faced another strong alliance captained by team 987. With past world champions and multiple regional winners on both sides, the competition was intense, but our alliance pulled through to become the champions of the Archimedes field. We advanced to the Einstein field, where we played teams who had advanced from other divisions. Our alliance faced even tougher competition there, but we became international semifinalists. 2008 was a great year for the UberBots.

The field was split into 3 sections by two 1-foot-tall bumps with tunnels in the middle, which allowed smaller robots to move between the sections without going over the bump. Robots were allowed to have kickers to kick the balls into 1 of the 2 goals per alliance at each corner of the field, for a total of 4 goals. Where the game stopped looking like soccer was at the end, where teams could climb up towers in the middle of the field for bonus points.\n\nWe knew we wanted our robot to be light, small, and maneuverable so we could quickly score as many soccer balls as possible, and so that we could move between sections of the field via the tunnels. In past years, we had always built our robot to do everything that it could. However, this year, because hanging was only worth 2 points, and soccer balls scored were worth 1 each, we decided that it made more sense to focus on scoring over hanging. Our robot, Striker, used a new drive system for us which gave each wheel a separate motor used window motors to turn the front and back wheels together. This allowed us to make tight turns and maneuver past defending robots to score. Though we built a pneumatic kicker that was quite effective, we mostly scored by "herding" or rolling soccer balls into the goals.\n\nThe UberBots had big plans for the 2010 season. Not only were we going to compete at 2 regionals for the first time ever, but we were planning to go for the Chairman''s Award. The Chairman''s award is the most prestigious Award given out by FIRST, to a team that spreads the message of FIRST, appreciation of science and technology, throughout their community. We had participated in many demos at schools and public places, and put together a video and an essay for the application.\n\nOur first regional was the WPI Regional. It was an early competition, so many teams, including us, were not in our prime. We only made it to the quarterfinals, where we were eliminated. However, we won the Chairman''s Award at WPI, even if we didn''t make it to the semifinals. We also won the Delphi Engineering Excellence Award for our robot''s elegant and simple design. The WPI Regional ended up going great, and it was good practice for our next event.\n\nThe Connecticut Regional was a fantastic event for the UberBots in 2010. We went undefeated throughout seeding and elimination matches, winning the the competition on an alliance with Team 102 (The Gearheads) and Team 383 (Brazilian Machine). Since our robot was offensive, we scored high and also won the Coopertition award, which calculated points based on both our score and our opponents'' score after each match. We had also helped numerous teams on other alliances during the competition, which is part of the Coopertition award. Because of our complex drive system which allowed us to switch between a swerve drive for tight turns, a rotated drive for kicking, and other modes, we were again awarded the Rockwell Innovation in Control Award.\n\nThe UberBots again went to Atlanta to compete in the Championship. The competition was intense, and we were eliminated in the quarter finals of our division.

The memories created there will be with the team forever. The UberBots also competed in Battlecry @ WPI in June, and Bash @ the Beach in October, an offseason event that we participate in to this day. The Bash @ the Beach was a great competition for our team because it allowed us to work in a competitive yet low-key environment with the new year''s team, as it takes place in October. We allied with teams 190 (Gompei Herd of Worchester, MA) and 500 (Waterford''s Team USA) and placed second.

The field was split into 3 sections by two 1-foot-tall bumps with tunnels in the middle, which allowed smaller robots to move between the sections without going over the bump. Robots were allowed to have kickers to kick the balls into 1 of the 2 goals per alliance at each corner of the field, for a total of 4 goals. Where the game stopped looking like soccer was at the end, where teams could climb up towers in the middle of the field for bonus points.\n\nWe knew we wanted our robot to be light, small, and maneuverable so we could quickly score as many soccer balls as possible, and so that we could move between sections of the field via the tunnels. In past years, we had always built our robot to do everything that it could. However, this year, because hanging was only worth 2 points, and soccer balls scored were worth 1 each, we decided that it made more sense to focus on scoring over hanging. Our robot, Striker, used a new drive system for us which gave each wheel a separate motor used window motors to turn the front and back wheels together. This allowed us to make tight turns and maneuver past defending robots to score. Though we built a pneumatic kicker that was quite effective, we mostly scored by "herding" or rolling soccer balls into the goals.\n\nThe UberBots had big plans for the 2010 season. Not only were we going to compete at 2 regionals for the first time ever, but we were planning to go for the Chairman''s Award.

We had participated in many demos at schools and public places, and put together a video and an essay for the application.\n\nOur first regional was the WPI Regional. It was an early competition, so many teams, including us, were not in our prime. We only made it to the quarterfinals, where we were eliminated. However, we won the Chairman''s Award at WPI, even if we didn''t make it to the semifinals. We also won the Delphi Engineering Excellence Award for our robot''s elegant and simple design. The WPI Regional ended up going great, and it was good practice for our next event.\n\nThe Connecticut Regional was a fantastic event for the UberBots in 2010. We went undefeated throughout seeding and elimination matches, winning the the competition on an alliance with Team 102 (The Gearheads) and Team 383 (Brazilian Machine). Since our robot was offensive, we scored high and also won the Coopertition award, which calculated points based on both our score and our opponents'' score after each match. We had also helped numerous teams on other alliances during the competition, which is part of the Coopertition award. Because of our complex drive system which allowed us to switch between a swerve drive for tight turns, a rotated drive for kicking, and other modes, we were again awarded the Rockwell Innovation in Control Award.\n\nThe UberBots again went to Atlanta to compete in the Championship. The competition was intense, and we were eliminated in the quarter finals of our division. However, we still placed well overall because our robot was able to score many balls quickly.\n\nWith many of our members outgoing seniors, and the loss of our practice spaces on the horizon, the UberBots were looking forward to a challenging 2011 season...<br>');

Teams could also earn points by "hurdling" the track balls over the 9-foot "overpass" in the middle of the field. The field was divided the long way down the center to give it a race-track feel. We responded to these aspects of the game in many ways as we designed and built our robot that year, Lightning.\n<br>\n<br>\nWe gave Lightning a two-speed transmission so that we could have both the speed to make it around the track and the precision to pick up the large track balls. To pick up and handle the large balls, we gave Lightning a 2-joint arm and a claw that could expand to wrap around the ball, then contract to keep possession of the ball as we moved around the field.\n<br>\n<br>\nWe built a second robot and a replica of the field in the space donated to us by Reflexite so that we could practice driving even after we had shipped our robot off after build season. We attended the Suffield Shakedown 2008 Scrimmage hosted by Team 176, Aces High. The competition was good practice for the new 2008 season''s team, and it let us see how other teams had tackled the challenges of the game. Allied with team 230 (the Gaelhawks) and team 1784 (the Litchbots), we won the scrimmage undefeated. Our team was also successful off the field, winning the spirit award for the first time ever. We were looking forward to how we would fare at the Connecticut regional.\n<br>\n<br>\nAt the Connecticut Regional, we won all our qualification matches, allied with numerous other great teams, and placed first in seeding among the 62 teams at the competition. This was a mark of progress for our team, as only two years ago we had had to fix our robot after every match. For the elimination matches, we allied with team 175 (Buzz Robotics) and team 716 (the Who''s-C-Teks). Through the quarterfinals, semifinals, and finals, our alliance went undefeated, winning the Connecticut Regional. During the award ceremony, we were honored with the Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers Entrepreneurship Award, recognizing our work in the community.\n<br>\n<br>\nIn 2008, the UberBots also competed in the Championship in Atlanta. In qualification, we achieved a 6-1 record, becoming the captains of the third alliance. We invited teams 1024 and 177 to be part of our alliance, creating a well-rounded team that could handle any situation on the field. Our alliance won in the quarterfinals and the semifinals, leading us to the finals where we faced another strong alliance captained by team 987. With past world champions and multiple regional winners on both sides, the competition was intense, but our alliance pulled through to become the champions of the Archimedes field. We advanced to the Einstein field, where we played teams who had advanced from other divisions. Our alliance faced even tougher competition there, but we became international semifinalists. 2008 was a great year for the UberBots.

Robots could only use special, slippery wheels, and they competed on a slippery surface of white, plasticy material called "regolith." The game was designed to simulate low gravity conditions in a lunar environment. To continue the theme, the gamepieces were small, light balls called "moonrocks." Robots started the game possessing up to 7 moonrocks, and many more were strewn throughout the field. Human players outside the field threw moonrocks at the trailers attached to each robot to score. Robots could also score on other robots by putting moonrocks into their opponents'' robots'' trailers.\n<br>\n<br>\nWe built our robot, Vortex, around possessing as many moonrocks as possible and being able to score them from a range. The main body had a sweeper that swept moonrocks into a spiral, which fed them up to the cannon.

Our alliance won in the quarterfinals and the semifinals, leading us to the finals where we faced another strong alliance captained by team 987. With past world champions and multiple regional winners on both sides, the competition was intense, but our alliance pulled through to become the champions of the Archimedes field. We advanced to the Einstein field, where we played teams who had advanced from other divisions.

The field was split into 3 sections by two 1-foot-tall bumps with tunnels in the middle, which allowed smaller robots to move between the sections without going over the bump. Robots were allowed to have kickers to kick the balls into 1 of the 2 goals per alliance at each corner of the field, for a total of 4 goals. Where the game stopped looking like soccer was at the end, where teams could climb up towers in the middle of the field for bonus points.\n\nWe knew we wanted our robot to be light, small, and maneuverable so we could quickly score as many soccer balls as possible, and so that we could move between sections of the field via the tunnels. In past years, we had always built our robot to do everything that it could. However, this year, because hanging was only worth 2 points, and soccer balls scored were worth 1 each, we decided that it made more sense to focus on scoring over hanging. Our robot, Striker, used a new drive system for us which gave each wheel a separate motor used window motors to turn the front and back wheels together. This allowed us to make tight turns and maneuver past defending robots to score. Though we built a pneumatic kicker that was quite effective, we mostly scored by "herding" or rolling soccer balls into the goals.\n\nThe UberBots had big plans for the 2010 season. Not only were we going to compete at 2 regionals for the first time ever, but we were planning to go for the Chairman''s Award. The Chairman''s award is the most prestigious Award given out by FIRST, to a team that spreads the message of FIRST, appreciation of science and technology, throughout their community. We had participated in many demos at schools and public places, and put together a video and an essay for the application.\n\nOur first regional was the WPI Regional. It was an early competition, so many teams, including us, were not in our prime. We only made it to the quarterfinals, where we were eliminated. However, we won the Chairman''s Award at WPI, even if we didn''t make it to the semifinals. We also won the Delphi Engineering Excellence Award for our robot''s elegant and simple design. The WPI Regional ended up going great, and it was good practice for our next event.\n\nThe Connecticut Regional was a fantastic event for the UberBots in 2010. We went undefeated throughout seeding and elimination matches, winning the the competition on an alliance with Team 102 (The Gearheads) and Team 383 (Brazilian Machine).

We had also helped numerous teams on other alliances during the competition, which is part of the Coopertition award.

Teams could also earn points by "hurdling" the track balls over the 9-foot "overpass" in the middle of the field. The field was divided the long way down the center to give it a race-track feel. We responded to these aspects of the game in many ways as we designed and built our robot that year, Lightning.\n<br>\n<br>\nWe gave Lightning a two-speed transmission so that we could have both the speed to make it around the track and the precision to pick up the large track balls. To pick up and handle the large balls, we gave Lightning a 2-joint arm and a claw that could expand to wrap around the ball, then contract to keep possession of the ball as we moved around the field.\n<br>\n<br>\nWe built a second robot and a replica of the field in the space donated to us by Reflexite so that we could practice driving even after we had shipped our robot off after build season. We attended the Suffield Shakedown 2008 Scrimmage hosted by Team 176, Aces High. The competition was good practice for the new 2008 season''s team, and it let us see how other teams had tackled the challenges of the game. Allied with team 230 (the Gaelhawks) and team 1784 (the Litchbots), we won the scrimmage undefeated. Our team was also successful off the field, winning the spirit award for the first time ever. We were looking forward to how we would fare at the Connecticut regional.\n<br>\n<br>\nAt the Connecticut Regional, we won all our qualification matches, allied with numerous other great teams, and placed first in seeding among the 62 teams at the competition. This was a mark of progress for our team, as only two years ago we had had to fix our robot after every match. For the elimination matches, we allied with team 175 (Buzz Robotics) and team 716 (the Who''s-C-Teks). Through the quarterfinals, semifinals, and finals, our alliance went undefeated, winning the Connecticut Regional. During the award ceremony, we were honored with the Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers Entrepreneurship Award, recognizing our work in the community.\n<br>\n<br>\nIn 2008, the UberBots also competed in the Championship in Atlanta. In qualification, we achieved a 6-1 record, becoming the captains of the third alliance. We invited teams 1024 and 177 to be part of our alliance, creating a well-rounded team that could handle any situation on the field. Our alliance won in the quarterfinals and the semifinals, leading us to the finals where we faced another strong alliance captained by team 987. With past world champions and multiple regional winners on both sides, the competition was intense, but our alliance pulled through to become the champions of the Archimedes field.

Our robot, which we named "Dynamite" included a 2-joint arm (with a "wrist" and "shoulder" motor and a gripper for a hand) which gave us great flexibility since we could both score by putting tubes on the rack and get points back by removing "spoiler" game pieces. Dynamite also had a set of deployable ramps long enough to hold two robots, which earned us bonus points. Dynamite also had hefty bumpers that allowed us to play defense if we needed to, and an autonomous mode with 16 different functions that allowed us to automatically raise Dynamite''s arm to different heights and other useful things.\n\nWe were able to "Rack ''n'' Roll" our way to the top, finishing as an alliance captain (in the top 8), and we ultimately won the UTC Connecticut Regional with team 195 (the CyberKnights of Southington) and team 558 (the RoboSquad from New Haven).

This time, however, we were ranked third after the division seeding matches, and allied with  teams 1592 (the Bionic Tigers from Cocoa, FL) and 1816 (The Green Machine, all the way from Edina, Minnesota!). Our powerful alliance brought us all the way to the division finals. The UberBots continued to Einstein as the backup bot for Newton''s champion. After the Championship, we competed at Battlecry @ WPI, hosted by team 190, where we seeded 1st for the first time ever.<br>'),

Robots could only use special, slippery wheels, and they competed on a slippery surface of white, plasticy material called "regolith." The game was designed to simulate low gravity conditions in a lunar environment. To continue the theme, the gamepieces were small, light balls called "moonrocks." Robots started the game possessing up to 7 moonrocks, and many more were strewn throughout the field. Human players outside the field threw moonrocks at the trailers attached to each robot to score. Robots could also score on other robots by putting moonrocks into their opponents'' robots'' trailers.\n<br>\n<br>\nWe built our robot, Vortex, around possessing as many moonrocks as possible and being able to score them from a range. The main body had a sweeper that swept moonrocks into a spiral, which fed them up to the cannon. The cannon was aimed by a camera, which tracked the vision targets on the opposing alliance''s trailers. Our systems team also created a sophisticated traction control system with encoders to minimize slippage on the slick field. As the competition progressed we modified our cannon to allow us to quickly dump multiple moon rocks into opponents'' trailers at close range.\n<br>\n<br>\nAfter a tough build season, our first event was the Suffield Shakedown, hosted by Aces High team 176, which we won on an alliance with teams 195 and 126. After that event, we competed in the Connecticut Regional. Although we didn''t make it as far as we had in previous years, we won the Rockwell Automation Innovation in Control Award for our traction control system and autonomous mode.\n<br>\n<br>\nAs with every past year, we competed in Atlanta, Georgia, in the Championship. The competition was great and a lot of fun, and we managed to make it to the quarterfinals on the Galileo Field, where we were eliminated by the alliance that went on to win the entire Championship.'),

The field was split into 3 sections by two 1-foot-tall bumps with tunnels in the middle, which allowed smaller robots to move between the sections without going over the bump. Robots were allowed to have kickers to kick the balls into 1 of the 2 goals per alliance at each corner of the field, for a total of 4 goals. Where the game stopped looking like soccer was at the end, where teams could climb up towers in the middle of the field for bonus points.\n\nWe knew we wanted our robot to be light, small, and maneuverable so we could quickly score as many soccer balls as possible, and so that we could move between sections of the field via the tunnels. In past years, we had always built our robot to do everything that it could. However, this year, because hanging was only worth 2 points, and soccer balls scored were worth 1 each, we decided that it made more sense to focus on scoring over hanging. Our robot, Striker, used a new drive system for us which gave each wheel a separate motor used window motors to turn the front and back wheels together. This allowed us to make tight turns and maneuver past defending robots to score. Though we built a pneumatic kicker that was quite effective, we mostly scored by "herding" or rolling soccer balls into the goals.\n\nThe UberBots had big plans for the 2010 season. Not only were we going to compete at 2 regionals for the first time ever, but we were planning to go for the Chairman''s Award. The Chairman''s award is the most prestigious Award given out by FIRST, to a team that spreads the message of FIRST, appreciation of science and technology, throughout their community. We had participated in many demos at schools and public places, and put together a video and an essay for the application.\n\nOur first regional was the WPI Regional. It was an early competition, so many teams, including us, were not in our prime. We only made it to the quarterfinals, where we were eliminated. However, we won the Chairman''s Award at WPI, even if we didn''t make it to the semifinals. We also won the Delphi Engineering Excellence Award for our robot''s elegant and simple design. The WPI Regional ended up going great, and it was good practice for our next event.\n\nThe Connecticut Regional was a fantastic event for the UberBots in 2010. We went undefeated throughout seeding and elimination matches, winning the the competition on an alliance with Team 102 (The Gearheads) and Team 383 (Brazilian Machine). Since our robot was offensive, we scored high and also won the Coopertition award, which calculated points based on both our score and our opponents'' score after each match. We had also helped numerous teams on other alliances during the competition, which is part of the Coopertition award. Because of our complex drive system which allowed us to switch between a swerve drive for tight turns, a rotated drive for kicking, and other modes, we were again awarded the Rockwell Innovation in Control Award.\n\nThe UberBots again went to Atlanta to compete in the Championship. The competition was intense, and we were eliminated in the quarter finals of our division. However, we still placed well overall because our robot was able to score many balls quickly.\n\nWith many of our members outgoing seniors, and the loss of our practice spaces on the horizon, the UberBots were looking forward to a challenging 2011 season...<br>'),

(959, 'code', '[h1]Team Structure[/h1]\nReturn to [ublink=o/resources/for_first_teams]FIRST Team Resources[/ublink]\n\nMaintaining a team requires a mixture of freedom and structure. Mentors and students comprise the active members that give the life and workforce to a team. The UberBots are run by a student-run Management Subteam. (One may notice I capitalized Management. This is because the word has gained such a proper-noun meaning within our team.)\n\nCurrently, the subteam is comprised of a President, Vice President, Secretary, Treasurer, and Community Liaison. The President is primarily the representative of the team when a singular presence is required and leads Management in its operations. The Vice President is second in command and presumes the President''s responsibilities when he or she isn''t available. In addition, the Vice President assists the other positions and fills in gaps in the team where needed. The secretary is in charge of taking meeting-minutes, attendance, keeping the calendar up to date, team communication, and collects forms and permission slips. The treasurer maintains the budget, deals with mentors to distribute funds, and collects and manages money. Our least self-explainitory position, however, is Community Liaison. He or she (along with the President) represent the team to the community and the outside world and leads the community team. He is responsible to schedule, plan, and lead fundraisers and demos as well as lead the community team and Chairman''s Team.\n\nThe Management Team is elected each year after the Championships (Atlanta/St. Louis). Members are nominated (or self nominated) for each position and from there we hold platforms and debates. Then each team member (including Seniors) casts one secret vote for each position, and one mentor tallies the ballots and announces the winners. Over the summer, the new Management works hard to prepare the team for the upcoming year. \n\nManagement works closely and meets regularly along with the team coach or mentors. They are generally responsible for making most decisions (except for regarding safety and money) and may be advised in their decisions by mentors. For example, if somebody on the team want to make a purchase, the treasurer is notified, who tells the management team, who decide whether or not to make a purchase, and if they decide to do so, go to the Coach for final approval.\n\nBelow Management, the team is divided into other subteams. Currently, we have a Systems Team, Mechanical Team, CAD Team, Website Team, and Community Team. The Systems Team programs and works with electronics. The Mechanical Team works on the physical and machinery aspects of the robot. The CAD Team models the robot on CAD programs and the Autodesk Award. The Website Team designs and maintains the website and prepares it for the Website Award. The Community Team works with the Community Liaison to plan demos and work on the Chairman''s Award. Students may pick to work with a specific subteam because of interests and skills, but are in no way restricted to staying with one subteam or stopped from taking part in a subteam.'),

Whether it be through a school function or at a public event, recruiting the next generation of UberBots is very important.\n\nOver the past few years we have used multiple strategies for recruitment. We use posters hung throughout our school along with morning P.A. announcements prior to important events.

I wanted to take some time and record some general knowledge within a management team; along with some areas to remember as a new management team.\n\nWhen you are a brand new member to the management team it is difficult to understand what needs to be done and any deadlines you need to abide by. Hopefully this "post" will help future management teams get off the ground running!\n\n[h2]Mass Emails:[/h2]\nIf your team doesn''t know when an event is happening, how could any members possibly show up? Questions like this are exactly why the UberBots mass email system exists. When an event is about a month away, send a mass email letting parents and team members know what is going on. To learn more about our procedures for mass emails, along with other processes please [url=http://uberbots.org/o/Resources/For_FIRST_Teams/General_Procedures]click here.[/url]\n\n\n[h2]Events: [/h2]\nWhen planning for an event, their are a few key items to remember:\nMentors: You can''t have an event or a meeting without one.\nAttendance roster: Ask who can attend each event and at what times, otherwise you may be alone at an event (no fun)...\nRemember permission slips, transportation (bus), and food.\n\n[h2]Competitions:[/h2]\nBash at the Beach: Usually the beginning to mid October, make sure you get a gift basket ready prior to the competition. Use donated items or purchase items that coordinate with a theme. Around $75\nDon''t just focus on the drive team!! The rest of the team is just as crucial! (ie: scouting and spirit)\n\n[h2]Management Emails:[/h2]\nThese are critical to your success. If you can outline what event / fundraiser / meeting agenda''s in chronological order it makes it much easier to prepare and execute your "plan". Also, after each event send a summary email, and outline what the plan for the next week -> month will look like. \n\nHere is an example of inter management emails from right after Avon Day 2010:\n\n[size=85]"Hey guys,\n\nAvon day was a huge success.

The controller attempts to minimize the error by adjusting according to three constants: P, I, and D (see next paragraph).</p>\n<img src="/omni/media/embedded/pid_structure.png" style="padding:1px;"/>\n<p>The PID Loop takes in two main variables: the process variable and the set point. The process variable (PV) changes through each run-through of the PID Loop. The set point (SP) is the desired value of the process variable. The Loop calculates an error between the PV and SP and tries to minimize it. The PID Loop also includes three constant parameters: Proportional (P), Integral (I), and Derivative (D). P is how severely the loop reacts to the error value. This is how much the robot compensates for the error value by changing the output. P uses multiplication to minimize the error. The I value determines the reaction of the loop based on the sum of recent errors. That is how much the reaction is changed. The reaction gets more severe if the robot takes longer to correct the error. I uses linear addition to minimize the error. The value for D determines the reaction to the error based on the rate of change in the error. This is the value which causes the PID to oscillate.\nThe P, I, and D outputs add together to create the output, which powers a mechanism (usually a motor) which in turn gives the PID feedRear through the PV. This process loops, creating a PID Loop.\n</p>\n<a href="#top">Top of Page</a>\n<br/><br/>\n<h2 id=''algorithms''>PID Algorithm</h2>\n<p>\n<img src="/omni/media/embedded/pid1.png" /><br/>\n<i>P<sub>out</sub>, I<sub>out</sub>, and D<sub>out</sub> are the contributions to the output from the PID controller from each of the three terms.</i>\n</p>\n<h3 id=''constant''>Constant Algorithms</h3>\n<p><img src="/omni/media/embedded/pid2.png" /><br/>\n<i>t=time; K<sub>p</sub>, <sub>i</sub>, and <sub>d</sub> are input parameters</i></p>\n<h3 id=''output''>Final Output Algorithm</h3>\n<p>\n<img src="/omni/media/embedded/pid3.png" /><br/>\n</p>\n<a href="#top">Top of Page</a>\n<br/><br/>'),

It''s basically a box with switches and LEDs. A green LED shines when the switch is on and a red LED shines when the switch is off. There are many usually many switches in a row. Additionally, each switch is connected to a Digital Input/Output (DIO) on a controller that reads "1" when the switch is on and "0" when the switch is off. This way, inputs can be passed to the robot, and the LEDs indicate the state of the switch to the driver.\n\nSwitchboxes may be connected to the Cypress FirstTouch PSoC 3 (which is connected to the operator console) or may be connected directly to the digital sidecar, setting configurations on the robot, such as for autonomous mode. Either way, the switchbox requires one DIO for each switch, a power source (VDD), and ground (VSS). Each switch requires either two LEDS or a biLED (three pins and can shine two different colors), a 1KÎ© resistor (a pulldown for the LEDs), a 10KÎ© resistor (a pullup for the DIO signal), and a single pole, double throw toggle switch (one common connects to one of two poles depending on its position). This list also assumes a lot of wires.\n\nSwitchboxes work well mounted inside a plastic (ABS) project box from RadioShack. If you''re using it with the PSoc, you may want to find a box that can hold the PSoC inside. The top can be drilled or milled in a CNC machine.\n\nNotice that one 1KÎ© resistor is used for every two LEDs (or one biLED, if you wish). If the two LEDs are going to run simultaneously, this is bad practice and should not be done. However, since the switch will only allow one LED to run at a time, using only one resistor is safe and advisable.\n\nThe schematic at right shows a four-switch switchbox, however it should be easy to scale to whatever size is necessary. The "+5V" doesn''t need to be exactly 5 volts. The 3.3 volts on the PSoC or the 6 volts on the sidecar should work fine. However, you may want to scale the pulldown resistors using Ohm''s law to ensure an appropriate voltage goes through the LEDs. I found the LEDs should be have about 3 milliamps flowing through them.');

(968, 'code', '<h1 id="nav">Website Focuses</h1>\n<p>When designing the OmniPage system, the UberBots website team had six main focus areas. They are: </p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href="#modular">Modular</a></li>\n<li><a href="#integrated">Integrated</a></li>\n<li><a href="#compliant">Compliant</a></li>\n<li><a href="#accessible">Handicap Accessible</a></li>\n<li><a href="#simple">Transparent/Simple</a></li>\n<li><a href="#visual">Visually Pleasing</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Return to <a href="http://uberbots.org/o/about/our_website">About our Website</a> page.</p>\n\n<h2 id="modular">Modular</h2>\n<p><img src="http://uberbots.org/omni/media/embedded/modular.png" style="float:left;padding-right:5px;" alt=''modular''/> Modularity is an important focus for the website because "it will be easier to fix bugs, keep compliance, keep uniformity, prevent errors, make editing easier, make coding simpler, and enhance the browsing experience" - Matt Howard, UberBots Forums. Having a modular website would replace the older system of individually coding pages from scratch. This system scatters code and makes it more difficult to program and maintain.  When pages include modules, or building blocks, it will make it much easier to build and keep a quality website. <br/>\nThe OmniPage system uses modules to keep content. Modules are building blocks for the website: a block of predefined code that serves a specific purpose. Different modules on the website keep content in a logical place and make for an overall better website and browsing experience.<br/><a href="#top">Top of Page</a></p>\n\n<h2 id="integrated">Integrated</h2>\n<p><img src=''http://uberbots.org/omni/media/embedded/integrated.png'' style="float:left;padding-right:5px;" alt=''integrated''/>The OmniPage system is integrated with many current technologies. First, the website is integrated with the UberBots <a href="http://uberbots.org/forums">Forums</a>, which provide login credentials and simplified permissions for administrative functions. This concept increases efficiency by only having the website files deal with one set of credentials and user properties. This not only reduces coding on the programming end, but also makes people only have to remember one set of login information. This integration will also simplify the ability to link calendar events to forum posts, for easily accessible meeting minutes and other information and discussion regarding meetings and events.<br/>\nThe website is also integrated with other websites and technologies. It helps to create a better website by helping people stay connected and informed with team happenings (see <a href="http://uberbots.org/o/about/our_website/advantages#communication">here</a>). Some technologies integrated into the OmniPage system include YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, RSS, and iCal.<br/><a href="#top">Top of Page</a></p>\n\n<h2 id="compliant">Compliant</h2>\n<p><img src="http://uberbots.org/omni/media/embedded/compliant.png" style="float:left;padding-right:5px;" alt=''compliant'' /> <a href="http://w3.org">The World Wide Web Consortium</a> (W3C) provides standards for the web. It is important to comply with these standards because it makes for a better website. These standards define how the web should be, and the UberBots want their website to be as current as possible, without sacrificing quality in older browsers. The website should look and function well in all major browsers, including Microsoft Internet Explorer (at least version 7), Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, Apple Safari, and Opera. Additionally, important technologies like RSS and iCal are important to have functioning, as they help enhance the browsing experience.<br/><a href="#top">Top of Page</a></p>\n\n<h2 id="accessible">Handicap Accessible</h2>\n<p><img src="http://uberbots.org/omni/media/embedded/accessible.png" style="float:left;padding-right:5px;" alt=''handicap accessible''/>Having a handicap accessible website ensures that everybody can see and enjoy the content, even if they are blind, deaf, or vision impaired. There are some easy things that can be done to make an accessible website, including alternate text for images, variable text size on pages, and captions in videos and animations. Having an accessible website will help to make sure the maximum amount of people can get the message of the UberBots and <a href=''http://uberbots.org/o/about/first''>FIRST</a>.<br/><a href="#top">Top of Page</a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p>\n\n<h2 id="simple"> Transparent & Simple</h2>\n<p><img src="http://uberbots.org/omni/media/embedded/simple.png" style="float:left;padding-right:5px;" />Simplicity is an important aspect of a good website. It is important to have a <a href="http://uberbots.org/o/sitemap">sitemap</a>. A sitemap helps users find the page they are looking for without too much trouble. It will also help search engines find pages on the site; this helps expose more people to resources on the site. Additionally, URLs of the site should be simple and easy to figure out. An example of this is the URL "uberbots.org/o/about/our_website." It is easy to figure out that this URL will lead to a page that talks about the website. Having simple URLs makes the site easier to navigate. Finally, the layout of the site should also be as informative as possible, but also as simple as possible. Keeping simplicity in the layouts makes sure that content is easy to find and can get all information necessary across to the end user.<br/><a href="#top">Top of Page</a></p> \n\n<h2 id="visual">Visually Pleasing</h2>\n<p><img src="http://uberbots.org/omni/media/embedded/visual.png" style="float:left;padding-right:5px;" />Having an ascetically pleasing website in the final focus of the OmniPage system. It is important to have a site that is nice to look at and makes the user enjoy looking at the site. Today, there are many websites that aren''t visually pleasing, and many users feel like visiting those sites is unnecessarily difficult. The OmniPage system has the ability to be visually pleasing through the use of skins. Skins are a set of HTML files separate from other parts of the site. The skin files are what actually take the data from modules and output it to a page (for more information on skins, go <a href="http://uberbots.org/o/about/our_website/advantages#skins">here</a>). The final output of the site should not be too cluttered and all content should be easily viewable in an easy to look at manor. Having a visually pleasing website could be the difference between an user returning to the site or not, so it''s important to make sure the looks of the site work in its favor.<br/><a href="#top">Top of Page</a></p>'),
(969, 'code', '[h1]Behind the Scenes of the Website[/h1]\n     The OmniPage system is an easily modifiable architecture for having an easily editable and modifiable website. The OmniPage system is written in [url=http://php.net]PHP[/url], with extensive use of [url=http://mysql.com]mySQL[/url]. The PHP files are integrated with the mySQL database, where they can get any content needed, as all of the website''s dynamic data and content is stored in that database. Formatting for the entire site is done in [url=http://w3.org/Style/CSS/]CSS[/url], to make a uniform style.\n     Pages and their content is also stored in the database. Content is output to the site in the form of [url=http://uberbots.org/o/about/our_website/advantages#modules]modules[/url], which are on [url=http://uberbots.org/o/about/our_website/advantages#pages]pages[/url]. A module is a predefined block of code that can be placed anywhere on the site to serve its purpose. This creates a "drag and drop" effect with code chunks, making it easy to put content on the site. Different modules serve different purposes. For example, the HTML module will output parsed HTML that the user input. The [url=http://bbcode.org]bbCode[/url] module will output parsed bbCode, a safe and simple way to provide formatting, commonly used on web forums.\n     The OmniPage system is also a skinnable engine. In order to change how the site looks, the website team simply has to create a new skin, or a different way of outputting content generated by modules. This gives the webmaster the ability to completely redesign the website without recoding it, or simply make a different way to view it, such as on mobile browsers. More information on skins can be found [url=http://uberbots.org/o/about/our_website/advantages#skins]here[/url].\n     The OmniPage system is also a secure system with dynamic and powerful user privileges. It is based off of phpBB''s permission system, which utilizes usergroups to make large scale permissions simple. More information on security can be found [url=http://uberbots.org/o/about/our_website/advantages#security]here[/url].\nAll in all, the OmniPage system is a very powerful website engine that was designed with simplicity and power in mind.\n\n[url=http://uberbots.org/o/about/our_website]About Our Website[/url]'),
(970, 'code', '<h1 id="nav">The Advantages of the OmniPage System</h1>\n<p>The OmniPage system makes it very easy to edit content on the site.

The OmniCore will find the correct page in the database, and return all of the content associated with that page. Having pages stored in the database makes it very easy to create pages, modify their properties, and delete them. Below is the form for creating a page.\n<img src=''http://uberbots.org/omni/media/embedded/addPage.png'' alt=''add page form'' style="border:1px solid #CCC"/><br/><a href="#top">Top of Page</a></p>\n\n<h2 id="modules">Modules</h2>\n<p><img src=''http://uberbots.org/omni/media/embedded/editbox.png'' alt=''edit page dropdown box'' style="float:right;padding-left:5px;"/>Adding and modifying content on a page is very easy to do, and does not require knowledge of HTML or PHP. All that is required is the addition of a module, is for the user to click on the edit button at the top of the page and select "Add Module." The user then picks which module type to add and selects it. <br/>Modules are also very easy to edit. And administrator simply has to select "Edit Module" from the drop down box and select the module to edit. Then, a graphical method of editing the module will appear, as determined in the module PHP file. Then, once the edit has been made, the new information will be updated in the database.<br/>Administrators also have the ability to review edits made to a module. They can view past states of modules and revert to that state if necessary. All edits are stored in the database along with other information related to that edit, including the user, time, IP, and previous content. <br/>\nThis ability to easily edit content on the site is very important. It makes it so editing and maintaining the website is no longer a role for someone who knows HTML. Now, the website content is no longer directly tied to the source file, making for an easily modifiable and modular experience while using the site. <br/><a href="#top">Top of Page</a>\n</p>\n\n<h2 id="skins">Skins</h2>\n<p>The OmniPage system is also a skinnable system. The ability to use skins makes it much easier to change the website''s design. Previously, the programmers would have to completely change how the site works in the very low level files in order to change the formatting. With the OmniPage skin system, changing how the site looks is simply a matter of editing a skin file. Skin files are HTML, CSS, and Javascript files that manage how the site appears to the user. These files are passed dynamic content through the module files via special functions. This content is then displayed in the skin and shown to the end user. Now, when the website team would like to change how the site looks, they simply have to create a new skin with all the necessary files, instead of recoding the site. Skins can also be used to provide a dynamic viewing experience. A special skin can be used to simply shake things up or to make the site mobile device friendly. Either way, the ability to have skins is an important feature of the OmniPage system.<br/><a href="#top">Top of Page</a></p>\n\n<h2 id="communication">Communication</h2>\n<p><a href="http://facebook.com/TheUberBots"><img src="http://uberbots.org/omni/media/embedded/facebook.png" style="float:right;padding-left:5px;"/></a>\nThe OmniPage system also integrates communication with team members into its architecture. There is native support for emailing all team members, as well as other groups of users (as determined through the forums). The website also supports sending out mass SMS messages to those who signed up. The website will automatically send out a mass SMS 24 hours before any event on the calendar, ensuring team members are informed about upcoming events. These features come in handy for alerting team members to news regarding the team.<br/>\nThe OmniCore is also integrated with social networking. The UberBots <a href=''http://twitter.com/team1124''>Twitter</a> Account and <a href="http://facebook.com/TheUberBots">Facebook</a> fanpage are linked to the website, making is easy to update both.<br/><a href="http://twitter.com/team1124"><img src="http://uberbots.org/omni/media/embedded/twitter.png" /></a><br/><a href="#top">Top of Page</a></p>\n\n<h2 id="security">Security</h2>\n<p>The OmniPage also has native security features. All user accounts are integrated with the UberBots phpBB <a href="http://uberbots.org/forums">forums</a>. Having this integration removes the hassle of team members having multiple accounts (for both main site and forums), a problem encountered in previous websites. The usage of forums accounts created an "all in one" user account that works for the entire UberBots website. <br/>Using the forums accounts also provides simple security features. PhpBB has native usergroups, which the OmniCore uses to decide whether a user can see or edit a certain page. Some groups have global permissions while others can only deal with certain pages. Administrators also have the ability to give certain users or groups special permissions (that aren''t native) for certain pages. This helps with maintaining website content; now any user can be responsible for a certain page and make sure it''s up to date. This system also ensures security with regard to editing content.<br/>\nThe OmniPage system also has native log features. When an administrative action is carried out, the system will automatically append an entry to a log text file with important information regarding the edit. Username, time, and the action are recorded. This record of events helps ensure security with administrative features.<br/><a href="#top">Top of Page</a></p>\n'),

Kamen worked with MIT mechanical engineering professor Dr. Woodie Flowers to create the first ever FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) at a New Hampshire high school in 1992.  From that point on, FIRST has grown to be one the largest robotics competitions in the world.  The program has over 250,000 students working on 22,600 robots with the assistance of over 68,000 mentors and 33,000 volunteers from all disciplines such as engineering, fund raising, and team leadership (project value, usfirst.org).

Instead, we raise funds through events and donations.\n\nMost team fundraisers are held at local restaurants.  Many have benefit or community nights where a portion of the profit is then donated to the team.  We also bring and demo robots and give out door prizes depending on the restaurant''s policy. \n\nFundraisers are best when planned ahead and spaced out throughout the pre-season.  It''s a good idea to visit local restaurants and talk to them about fundraising.  Different businesses have different policies, so be sure to talk to them ahead of time. Try to spread out the scheduling of each event as well, if there are three in only a few weeks, not as many people will attend.\n\nOnce scheduled, don''t forget about the fundraiser! There is a lot of planning to do before it happens.  One of the biggest things is advertising.  If no one knows, no one will show up.  At our school,we try to put up posters, get on the announcements, and send out emails through the team and school websites.  Recently, we''ve also gotten onto the calendar pages of local newspapers as well.  Get creative, and try to advertise with at least three different ways. The more people that come, the better.\n\nWhen planning, don''t forget to get team coverage.  We recommend using a sign up sheet, and depending on the length, having team members and mentors come in shifts.  Make sure you have information about the team (brochures, flyers, posters, etc.).  Also, be sure to bring everything for the robot if it''s being demoed.  \n\nAt some fundraisers, we are allowed to take donations, though teams should check with the business first. It''s always a good idea to try to bring people over to wherever the team is set up and talk to them about FIRST. Be friendly to everyone and make sure the team is respectful.\n\nMost importantly, be sure to thank the manager for helping the team out.  We suggest writing a thank you note, such as the example under files and documents.  It''s very important to show your appreciation.\n\n'),

All that is required is the addition of a module, is for the user to click on the edit button at the top of the page and select "Add Module." The user then picks which module type to add and selects it. <br/>Modules are also very easy to edit. And administrator simply has to select "Edit Module" from the drop down box and select the module to edit. Then, a graphical method of editing the module will appear, as determined in the module PHP file. Then, once the edit has been made, the new information will be updated in the database.<br/>Administrators also have the ability to review edits made to a module. They can view past states of modules and revert to that state if necessary. All edits are stored in the database along with other information related to that edit, including the user, time, IP, and previous content. <br/>\nThis ability to easily edit content on the site is very important. It makes it so editing and maintaining the website is no longer a role for someone who knows HTML.

The ability to use skins makes it much easier to change the website''s design. Previously, the programmers would have to completely change how the site works in the very low level files in order to change the formatting. With the OmniPage skin system, changing how the site looks is simply a matter of editing a skin file. Skin files are HTML, CSS, and Javascript files that manage how the site appears to the user. These files are passed dynamic content through the module files via special functions. This content is then displayed in the skin and shown to the end user. Now, when the website team would like to change how the site looks, they simply have to create a new skin with all the necessary files, instead of recoding the site. Skins can also be used to provide a dynamic viewing experience. A special skin can be used to simply shake things up or to make the site mobile device friendly. Either way, the ability to have skins is an important feature of the OmniPage system.<br/><a href="#top">Top of Page</a></p>\n\n<h2 id="communication">Communication</h2>\n<p><a href="http://facebook.com/TheUberBots"><img src="http://uberbots.org/omni/media/embedded/facebook.png" style="float:right;padding-left:5px;"/></a>\nThe OmniPage system also integrates communication with team members into its architecture. There is native support for emailing all team members, as well as other groups of users (as determined through the forums).

The website will automatically send out a mass SMS 24 hours before any event on the calendar, ensuring team members are informed about upcoming events. These features come in handy for alerting team members to news regarding the team.<br/>\nThe OmniCore is also integrated with social networking.

Having this integration removes the hassle of team members having multiple accounts (for both main site and forums), a problem encountered in previous websites. The usage of forums accounts created an "all in one" user account that works for the entire UberBots website. <br/>Using the forums accounts also provides simple security features. PhpBB has native usergroups, which the OmniCore uses to decide whether a user can see or edit a certain page. Some groups have global permissions while others can only deal with certain pages. Administrators also have the ability to give certain users or groups special permissions (that aren''t native) for certain pages. This helps with maintaining website content; now any user can be responsible for a certain page and make sure it''s up to date. This system also ensures security with regard to editing content.<br/>\nThe OmniPage system also has native log features.

This system also ensures security with regard to editing content.<br/>\nThe OmniPage system also has native log features. When an administrative action is carried out, the system will automatically append an entry to a log text file with important information regarding the edit. Username, time, and the action are recorded. This record of events helps ensure security with administrative features.<br/><a href="#top">Top of Page</a></p>\n'),

OmniPage is a database-oriented modular content management system that allows for simple administration and design of a web site. The OmniPage system separates code and content, making editing and maintenance easy. All code is contained within included PHP scripts and all content is stored in the database. The OmniCore takes the content from the database and integrates it with the code.</p>\n<a href="#top">Top of Page</a><br/><br/>\n\n<h3 id=''directory''>Directory Structure</h3>\n<p>All content for the site is stored in the `omni` database. Code is stored in the /omni directory. There are seven subdirectories to the /omni directory. They are: \n<ul>\n<li>actions<br/>\nThe actions subdirectory contains files that are called from modules and other places. Some examples are cron jobs, mass emailing, and ical file making.</li>\n<li>ajax<br/>\nThe ajax subdirectory contains all files called via ajax. They are mostly editing files, but also the calendar module uses this directory.</li>\n<li>includes<br/>\nThis subdirectory contains all files included in all other files. Include files mostly contain functions called by other scripts.</li>\n<li>logs<br/>\nThe logs subdirectory contains all logs site logs for administrative actions.</li>\n<li>media<br/>\nThe media subdirectory contains all media files for the photo gallery, files and documents, and other assorted media across the site.</li>\n<li>modules<br/>\nThe modules subdirectory contains all modules on the site. Each module has its own directory and within that directory is all files needed by that module.</li>\n<li>skins<br/>\nThe skins subdirectory contains all skins that are used by the site. Each skin has its own directory which contains all required files.</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n<a href="#top">Top of Page</a><br/><br/>\n'),

(1016, 'code', '<h1 id="nav">Website Focuses</h1>\n<p>When designing the OmniPage system, the UberBots website team had six main focus areas. They are: </p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href="#modular">Modular</a></li>\n<li><a href="#integrated">Integrated</a></li>\n<li><a href="#compliant">Compliant</a></li>\n<li><a href="#accessible">Handicap Accessible</a></li>\n<li><a href="#simple">Transparent/Simple</a></li>\n<li><a href="#visual">Visually Pleasing</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id="modular">Modular</h2>\n<p><img src="http://uberbots.org/omni/media/embedded/modular.png" style="float:left;padding-right:5px;" alt=''modular''/> Modularity is an important focus for the website because "it will be easier to fix bugs, keep compliance, keep uniformity, prevent errors, make editing easier, make coding simpler, and enhance the browsing experience" - Matt Howard, UberBots Forums. Having a modular website would replace the older system of individually coding pages from scratch. This system scatters code and makes it more difficult to program and maintain.  When pages include modules, or building blocks, it will make it much easier to build and keep a quality website. <br/>\nThe OmniPage system uses modules to keep content. Modules are building blocks for the website: a block of predefined code that serves a specific purpose. Different modules on the website keep content in a logical place and make for an overall better website and browsing experience.<br/><a href="#top">Top of Page</a></p>\n\n<h2 id="integrated">Integrated</h2>\n<p><img src=''http://uberbots.org/omni/media/embedded/integrated.png'' style="float:left;padding-right:5px;" alt=''integrated''/>The OmniPage system is integrated with many current technologies. First, the website is integrated with the UberBots <a href="http://uberbots.org/forums">Forums</a>, which provide login credentials and simplified permissions for administrative functions. This concept increases efficiency by only having the website files deal with one set of credentials and user properties. This not only reduces coding on the programming end, but also makes people only have to remember one set of login information. This integration will also simplify the ability to link calendar events to forum posts, for easily accessible meeting minutes and other information and discussion regarding meetings and events.<br/>\nThe website is also integrated with other websites and technologies. It helps to create a better website by helping people stay connected and informed with team happenings (see <a href="http://uberbots.org/o/about/our_website/advantages#communication">here</a>). Some technologies integrated into the OmniPage system include YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, RSS, and iCal.<br/><a href="#top">Top of Page</a></p>\n\n<h2 id="compliant">Compliant</h2>\n<p><img src="http://uberbots.org/omni/media/embedded/compliant.png" style="float:left;padding-right:5px;" alt=''compliant'' /> <a href="http://w3.org">The World Wide Web Consortium</a> (W3C) provides standards for the web. It is important to comply with these standards because it makes for a better website. These standards define how the web should be, and the UberBots want their website to be as current as possible, without sacrificing quality in older browsers. The website should look and function well in all major browsers, including Microsoft Internet Explorer (at least version 7), Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, Apple Safari, and Opera. Additionally, important technologies like RSS and iCal are important to have functioning, as they help enhance the browsing experience.<br/><a href="#top">Top of Page</a></p>\n\n<h2 id="accessible">Handicap Accessible</h2>\n<p><img src="http://uberbots.org/omni/media/embedded/accessible.png" style="float:left;padding-right:5px;" alt=''handicap accessible''/>Having a handicap accessible website ensures that everybody can see and enjoy the content, even if they are blind, deaf, or vision impaired. There are some easy things that can be done to make an accessible website, including alternate text for images, variable text size on pages, and captions in videos and animations. Having an accessible website will help to make sure the maximum amount of people can get the message of the UberBots and <a href=''http://uberbots.org/o/about/first''>FIRST</a>.<br/><a href="#top">Top of Page</a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p>\n\n<h2 id="simple"> Transparent & Simple</h2>\n<p><img src="http://uberbots.org/omni/media/embedded/simple.png" style="float:left;padding-right:5px;" />Simplicity is an important aspect of a good website. It is important to have a <a href="http://uberbots.org/o/sitemap">sitemap</a>. A sitemap helps users find the page they are looking for without too much trouble. It will also help search engines find pages on the site; this helps expose more people to resources on the site. Additionally, URLs of the site should be simple and easy to figure out. An example of this is the URL "uberbots.org/o/about/our_website." It is easy to figure out that this URL will lead to a page that talks about the website. Having simple URLs makes the site easier to navigate. Finally, the layout of the site should also be as informative as possible, but also as simple as possible. Keeping simplicity in the layouts makes sure that content is easy to find and can get all information necessary across to the end user.<br/><a href="#top">Top of Page</a></p> \n\n<h2 id="visual">Visually Pleasing</h2>\n<p><img src="http://uberbots.org/omni/media/embedded/visual.png" style="float:left;padding-right:5px;" />Having an ascetically pleasing website in the final focus of the OmniPage system. It is important to have a site that is nice to look at and makes the user enjoy looking at the site. Today, there are many websites that aren''t visually pleasing, and many users feel like visiting those sites is unnecessarily difficult. The OmniPage system has the ability to be visually pleasing through the use of skins. Skins are a set of HTML files separate from other parts of the site. The skin files are what actually take the data from modules and output it to a page (for more information on skins, go <a href="http://uberbots.org/o/about/our_website/advantages#skins">here</a>). The final output of the site should not be too cluttered and all content should be easily viewable in an easy to look at manor. Having a visually pleasing website could be the difference between an user returning to the site or not, so it''s important to make sure the looks of the site work in its favor.<br/><a href="#top">Top of Page</a></p>'),

The ESOP was formed to transfer stock from the founding brothers to the employees. Over the years, the ESOP has grown to be the largest shareholder in the company and all employee-owners throughout the company are members of the Reflexite ESOP. It is through their ownership in the company that employees participate in the financial rewards of business success, governance of the corporation, and participation in decision making that effects their work lives. Ownership also creates pride. Pride in our products, our services, and our business integrity. The third fundamental that was added in 1989 is Quality.

We made it possible to cross oceans and continents in hours, not days. We made it possible to fly around the world in wide-bodied comfort. Over the years, we have patented hundreds of innovations, from heat-resistant coatings to aerodynamic blades - technologies that make air travel more cost effective, more comfortable and more dependable. Today, Pratt & Whitney engines power nearly half of the world''s commercial fleet. Every few seconds - more than 20,000 times a day - a Pratt & Whitney-powered airliner takes flight somewhere in the world. Our military engines power the Air Force''s front line fighters today - the F-15 and F-16 - and our F119 and F135 engines will power the front line fighters of the future - the F/A-22 Raptor and F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. Our rocket engines send payloads into orbit at 20,000 miles per hour. Our gas turbines are also used to generate electricity in a growing number of locations. And Pratt & Whitney Canada is the world''s leading producer of engines for corporate jets, commuter aircraft and helicopters. Today''s competitive aviation industry demands far more than power from an aircraft engine. It demands thrust at the lowest possible cost and the highest level of reliability. We provide our customers with the services they need to concentrate on flying people and cargo safely around the world. In a business that shrinks the globe, Pratt & Whitney is truly worldwide. We have representatives in 76 cities in 47 nations. Our partnerships and joint ventures in Asia and Europe extend our reach and keep us at the forefront of flight. Since 1925, Pratt & Whitney''s engines have broken the barriers of time, the distances between people and places.

Instead, we raise funds through events and donations.\n\nMost team fundraisers are held at local restaurants.  Many have benefit or community nights where a portion of the profit is then donated to the team.  We also bring and demo robots and give out door prizes depending on the restaurant''s policy. \n\nFundraisers are best when planned ahead and spaced out throughout the pre-season.  It''s a good idea to visit local restaurants and talk to them about fundraising.  Different businesses have different policies, so be sure to talk to them ahead of time. Try to spread out the scheduling of each event as well, if there are three in only a few weeks, not as many people will attend.\n\nOnce scheduled, don''t forget about the fundraiser! There is a lot of planning to do before it happens.  One of the biggest things is advertising.  If no one knows, no one will show up.  At our school,we try to put up posters, get on the announcements, and send out emails through the team and school websites.  Recently, we''ve also gotten onto the calendar pages of local newspapers as well.  Get creative, and try to advertise with at least three different ways. The more people that come, the better.\n\nWhen planning, don''t forget to get team coverage.  We recommend using a sign up sheet, and depending on the length, having team members and mentors come in shifts.  Make sure you have information about the team (brochures, flyers, posters, etc.).  Also, be sure to bring everything for the robot if it''s being demoed.  \n\nAt some fundraisers, we are allowed to take donations, though teams should check with the business first. It''s always a good idea to try to bring people over to wherever the team is set up and talk to them about FIRST. Be friendly to everyone and make sure the team is respectful.\n\nMost importantly, be sure to thank the manager for helping the team out.  We suggest writing a thank you note, such as the example under files and documents.  It''s very important to show your appreciation.\n\n'),

(ie: scouting and spirit)\n\n[h2]Management Emails:[/h2]\nThese are critical to your success. If you can outline what event / fundraiser / meeting agenda''s in chronological order it makes it much easier to prepare and execute your "plan". Also, after each event send a summary email, and outline what the plan for the next week -> month will look like. \n\nHere is an example of inter management emails from right after Avon Day 2010:\n\n[size=85]"Hey guys,\n\nAvon day was a huge success.

(1070, 'code', '[h1]Switchbox Design[/h1]\n\n[imgflo=right]/omni/media/embedded/switchbox_schematic.png[/imgflo]Switchboxes are useful for many purposes. It''s basically a box with switches and LEDs. A green LED shines when the switch is on and a red LED shines when the switch is off. There are many usually many switches in a row. Additionally, each switch is connected to a Digital Input/Output (DIO) on a controller that reads "1" when the switch is on and "0" when the switch is off. This way, inputs can be passed to the robot, and the LEDs indicate the state of the switch to the driver.\n\nSwitchboxes may be connected to the Cypress FirstTouch PSoC 3 (which is connected to the operator console) or may be connected directly to the digital sidecar, setting configurations on the robot, such as for autonomous mode. Either way, the switchbox requires one DIO for each switch, a power source (VDD), and ground (VSS). Each switch requires either two LEDS or a biLED (three pins and can shine two different colors), a 1KÎ© resistor (a pulldown for the LEDs), a 10KÎ© resistor (a pullup for the DIO signal), and a single pole, double throw toggle switch (one common connects to one of two poles depending on its position). This list also assumes a lot of wires.\n\nSwitchboxes work well mounted inside a plastic (ABS) project box from RadioShack. If you''re using it with the PSoc, you may want to find a box that can hold the PSoC inside. The top can be drilled or milled in a CNC machine.\n\nNotice that one 1KÎ© resistor is used for every two LEDs (or one biLED, if you wish). If the two LEDs are going to run simultaneously, this is bad practice and should not be done. However, since the switch will only allow one LED to run at a time, using only one resistor is safe and advisable.\n\nThe schematic at right shows a four-switch switchbox, however it should be easy to scale to whatever size is necessary. The "+5V" doesn''t need to be exactly 5 volts. The 3.3 volts on the PSoC or the 6 volts on the sidecar should work fine. However, you may want to scale the pulldown resistors using Ohm''s law to ensure an appropriate voltage goes through the LEDs. I found the LEDs should be have about 3 milliamps flowing through them.'),
(1071, 'code', '[h1]Team Structure[/h1]\n\nMaintaining a team requires a mixture of freedom and structure. Mentors and students comprise the active members that give the life and workforce to a team. The UberBots are run by a student-run Management Subteam. (One may notice I capitalized Management. This is because the word has gained such a proper-noun meaning within our team.)\n\nCurrently, the subteam is comprised of a President, Vice President, Secretary, Treasurer, and Community Liaison. The President is primarily the representative of the team when a singular presence is required and leads Management in its operations. The Vice President is second in command and presumes the President''s responsibilities when he or she isn''t available. In addition, the Vice President assists the other positions and fills in gaps in the team where needed. The secretary is in charge of taking meeting-minutes, attendance, keeping the calendar up to date, team communication, and collects forms and permission slips. The treasurer maintains the budget, deals with mentors to distribute funds, and collects and manages money. Our least self-explainitory position, however, is Community Liaison. He or she (along with the President) represent the team to the community and the outside world and leads the community team. He is responsible to schedule, plan, and lead fundraisers and demos as well as lead the community team and Chairman''s Team.\n\nThe Management Team is elected each year after the Championships (Atlanta/St. Louis). Members are nominated (or self nominated) for each position and from there we hold platforms and debates. Then each team member (including Seniors) casts one secret vote for each position, and one mentor tallies the ballots and announces the winners. Over the summer, the new Management works hard to prepare the team for the upcoming year. \n\nManagement works closely and meets regularly along with the team coach or mentors. They are generally responsible for making most decisions (except for regarding safety and money) and may be advised in their decisions by mentors. For example, if somebody on the team want to make a purchase, the treasurer is notified, who tells the management team, who decide whether or not to make a purchase, and if they decide to do so, go to the Coach for final approval.\n\nBelow Management, the team is divided into other subteams. Currently, we have a Systems Team, Mechanical Team, CAD Team, Website Team, and Community Team. The Systems Team programs and works with electronics. The Mechanical Team works on the physical and machinery aspects of the robot. The CAD Team models the robot on CAD programs and the Autodesk Award. The Website Team designs and maintains the website and prepares it for the Website Award. The Community Team works with the Community Liaison to plan demos and work on the Chairman''s Award. Students may pick to work with a specific subteam because of interests and skills, but are in no way restricted to staying with one subteam or stopped from taking part in a subteam.'),

Robots could only use special, slippery wheels, and they competed on a slippery surface of white, plasticy material called "regolith." The game was designed to simulate low gravity conditions in a lunar environment. To continue the theme, the gamepieces were small, light balls called "moonrocks." Robots started the game possessing up to 7 moonrocks, and many more were strewn throughout the field. Human players outside the field threw moonrocks at the trailers attached to each robot to score. Robots could also score on other robots by putting moonrocks into their opponents'' robots'' trailers.\n<br>\n<br>\nWe built our robot, Vortex, around possessing as many moonrocks as possible and being able to score them from a range. The main body had a sweeper that swept moonrocks into a spiral, which fed them up to the cannon. The cannon was aimed by a camera, which tracked the vision targets on the opposing alliance''s trailers. Our systems team also created a sophisticated traction control system with encoders to minimize slippage on the slick field. As the competition progressed we modified our cannon to allow us to quickly dump multiple moon rocks into opponents'' trailers at close range.\n<br>\n<br>\nAfter a tough build season, our first event was the Suffield Shakedown, hosted by Aces High team 176, which we won on an alliance with teams 195 and 126. After that event, we competed in the Connecticut Regional. Although we didn''t make it as far as we had in previous years, we won the Rockwell Automation Innovation in Control Award for our traction control system and autonomous mode.\n<br>\n<br>\nAs with every past year, we competed in Atlanta, Georgia, in the Championship. The competition was great and a lot of fun, and we managed to make it to the quarterfinals on the Galileo Field, where we were eliminated by the alliance that went on to win the entire Championship.'),

Teams could also earn points by "hurdling" the track balls over the 9-foot "overpass" in the middle of the field. The field was divided the long way down the center to give it a race-track feel. We responded to these aspects of the game in many ways as we designed and built our robot that year, Lightning.\n<br>\n<br>\nWe gave Lightning a two-speed transmission so that we could have both the speed to make it around the track and the precision to pick up the large track balls. To pick up and handle the large balls, we gave Lightning a 2-joint arm and a claw that could expand to wrap around the ball, then contract to keep possession of the ball as we moved around the field.\n<br>\n<br>\nWe built a second robot and a replica of the field in the space donated to us by Reflexite so that we could practice driving even after we had shipped our robot off after build season. We attended the Suffield Shakedown 2008 Scrimmage hosted by Team 176, Aces High. The competition was good practice for the new 2008 season''s team, and it let us see how other teams had tackled the challenges of the game. Allied with team 230 (the Gaelhawks) and team 1784 (the Litchbots), we won the scrimmage undefeated. Our team was also successful off the field, winning the spirit award for the first time ever. We were looking forward to how we would fare at the Connecticut regional.\n<br>\n<br>\nAt the Connecticut Regional, we won all our qualification matches, allied with numerous other great teams, and placed first in seeding among the 62 teams at the competition. This was a mark of progress for our team, as only two years ago we had had to fix our robot after every match. For the elimination matches, we allied with team 175 (Buzz Robotics) and team 716 (the Who''s-C-Teks). Through the quarterfinals, semifinals, and finals, our alliance went undefeated, winning the Connecticut Regional. During the award ceremony, we were honored with the Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers Entrepreneurship Award, recognizing our work in the community.\n<br>\n<br>\nIn 2008, the UberBots also competed in the Championship in Atlanta. In qualification, we achieved a 6-1 record, becoming the captains of the third alliance. We invited teams 1024 and 177 to be part of our alliance, creating a well-rounded team that could handle any situation on the field. Our alliance won in the quarterfinals and the semifinals, leading us to the finals where we faced another strong alliance captained by team 987. With past world champions and multiple regional winners on both sides, the competition was intense, but our alliance pulled through to become the champions of the Archimedes field. We advanced to the Einstein field, where we played teams who had advanced from other divisions. Our alliance faced even tougher competition there, but we became international semifinalists. 2008 was a great year for the UberBots. We went undefeated in all our regionals, and advanced all the way to the world semifinals in Atlanta.\n<br>'),

The field was split into 3 sections by two 1-foot-tall bumps with tunnels in the middle, which allowed smaller robots to move between the sections without going over the bump. Robots were allowed to have kickers to kick the balls into 1 of the 2 goals per alliance at each corner of the field, for a total of 4 goals. Where the game stopped looking like soccer was at the end, where teams could climb up towers in the middle of the field for bonus points.\n\nWe knew we wanted our robot to be light, small, and maneuverable so we could quickly score as many soccer balls as possible, and so that we could move between sections of the field via the tunnels. In past years, we had always built our robot to do everything that it could. However, this year, because hanging was only worth 2 points, and soccer balls scored were worth 1 each, we decided that it made more sense to focus on scoring over hanging. Our robot, Striker, used a new drive system for us which gave each wheel a separate motor used window motors to turn the front and back wheels together. This allowed us to make tight turns and maneuver past defending robots to score. Though we built a pneumatic kicker that was quite effective, we mostly scored by "herding" or rolling soccer balls into the goals.\n\nThe UberBots had big plans for the 2010 season. Not only were we going to compete at 2 regionals for the first time ever, but we were planning to go for the Chairman''s Award. The Chairman''s award is the most prestigious Award given out by FIRST, to a team that spreads the message of FIRST, appreciation of science and technology, throughout their community. We had participated in many demos at schools and public places, and put together a video and an essay for the application.\n\nOur first regional was the WPI Regional. It was an early competition, so many teams, including us, were not in our prime. We only made it to the quarterfinals, where we were eliminated. However, we won the Chairman''s Award at WPI, even if we didn''t make it to the semifinals. We also won the Delphi Engineering Excellence Award for our robot''s elegant and simple design. The WPI Regional ended up going great, and it was good practice for our next event.\n\nThe Connecticut Regional was a fantastic event for the UberBots in 2010. We went undefeated throughout seeding and elimination matches, winning the the competition on an alliance with Team 102 (The Gearheads) and Team 383 (Brazilian Machine). Since our robot was offensive, we scored high and also won the Coopertition award, which calculated points based on both our score and our opponents'' score after each match.

The field was split into 3 sections by two 1-foot-tall bumps with tunnels in the middle, which allowed smaller robots to move between the sections without going over the bump. Robots were allowed to have kickers to kick the balls into 1 of the 2 goals per alliance at each corner of the field, for a total of 4 goals. Where the game stopped looking like soccer was at the end, where teams could climb up towers in the middle of the field for bonus points.\n\nWe knew we wanted our robot to be light, small, and maneuverable so we could quickly score as many soccer balls as possible, and so that we could move between sections of the field via the tunnels. In past years, we had always built our robot to do everything that it could. However, this year, because hanging was only worth 2 points, and soccer balls scored were worth 1 each, we decided that it made more sense to focus on scoring over hanging. Our robot, Striker, used a new drive system for us which gave each wheel a separate motor used window motors to turn the front and back wheels together. This allowed us to make tight turns and maneuver past defending robots to score. Though we built a pneumatic kicker that was quite effective, we mostly scored by "herding" or rolling soccer balls into the goals.\n\nThe UberBots had big plans for the 2010 season. Not only were we going to compete at 2 regionals for the first time ever, but we were planning to go for the Chairman''s Award. The Chairman''s award is the most prestigious Award given out by FIRST, to a team that spreads the message of FIRST, appreciation of science and technology, throughout their community. We had participated in many demos at schools and public places, and put together a video and an essay for the application.\n\nOur first regional was the WPI Regional. It was an early competition, so many teams, including us, were not in our prime. We only made it to the quarterfinals, where we were eliminated. However, we won the Chairman''s Award at WPI, even if we didn''t make it to the semifinals. We also won the Delphi Engineering Excellence Award for our robot''s elegant and simple design. The WPI Regional ended up going great, and it was good practice for our next event.\n\nThe Connecticut Regional was a fantastic event for the UberBots in 2010. We went undefeated throughout seeding and elimination matches, winning the competition on an alliance with Team 102 (The Gearheads) and Team 383 (Brazilian Machine). Since our robot was offensive, we scored high and also won the Coopertition award, which calculated points based on both our score and our opponents'' score after each match. We had also helped numerous teams on other alliances during the competition, which is part of the Coopertition award. Because of our complex drive system which allowed us to switch between a swerve drive for tight turns, a rotated drive for kicking, and other modes, we were again awarded the Rockwell Innovation in Control Award.\n\nThe UberBots again went to Atlanta to compete in the Championship.

Teams could also earn points by "hurdling" the track balls over the 9-foot "overpass" in the middle of the field. The field was divided the long way down the center to give it a race-track feel. We responded to these aspects of the game in many ways as we designed and built our robot that year, Lightning.\n<br>\n<br>\nWe gave Lightning a two-speed transmission so that we could have both the speed to make it around the track and the precision to pick up the large track balls.

The competition was good practice for the new 2008 season''s team, and it let us see how other teams had tackled the challenges of the game. Allied with team 230 (the Gaelhawks) and team 1784 (the Litchbots), we won the scrimmage undefeated. Our team was also successful off the field, winning the spirit award for the first time ever. We were looking forward to how we would fare at the Connecticut regional.\n<br>\n<br>\nAt the Connecticut Regional, we won all our qualification matches, allied with numerous other great teams, and placed first in seeding among the 62 teams at the competition. This was a mark of progress for our team, as only two years ago we had had to fix our robot after every match. For the elimination matches, we allied with team 175 (Buzz Robotics) and team 716 (the Who''s-C-Teks).

Our alliance won in the quarterfinals and the semifinals, leading us to the finals where we faced another strong alliance captained by team 987. With past world champions and multiple regional winners on both sides, the competition was intense, but our alliance pulled through to become the champions of the Archimedes field. We advanced to the Einstein field, where we played teams who had advanced from other divisions. Our alliance faced even tougher competition there, but we became international semifinalists. 2008 was a great year for the UberBots.

Our robot, which we named "Dynamite" included a 2-joint arm (with a "wrist" and "shoulder" motor and a gripper for a hand) which gave us great flexibility since we could both score by putting tubes on the rack and get points back by removing "spoiler" game pieces. Dynamite also had a set of deployable ramps long enough to hold two robots, which earned us bonus points. Dynamite also had hefty bumpers that allowed us to play defense if we needed to, and an autonomous mode with 16 different functions that allowed us to automatically raise Dynamite''s arm to different heights and other useful things.\n\nWe were able to "Rack ''n'' Roll" our way to the top, finishing as an alliance captain (in the top 8), and we ultimately won the UTC Connecticut Regional with team 195 (the CyberKnights of Southington) and team 558 (the RoboSquad from New Haven). For the second year in a row, we traveled to Atlanta to compete in the nationals, ending up in the Newton division again. This time, however, we were ranked third after the division seeding matches, and allied with  teams 1592 (the Bionic Tigers from Cocoa, FL) and 1816 (The Green Machine, all the way from Edina, Minnesota!). Our powerful alliance brought us all the way to the division finals. The UberBots continued to Einstein as the backup bot for Newton''s champion. After the Championship, we competed at Battlecry @ WPI, hosted by team 190, where we seeded 1st for the first time ever.<br>'),

After our final seeding match we were ranked 34th, but teams 177 (Bobcat Robotics of South Windsor) and 176 (Aces High from Suffield and Windsor Locks High Schools) had faith in our team and chose us to be their alliance partner. With a lot of team work and a little luck, the UberBots and our alliance partners battled our way to the top to win the UTC New England regional.\n\nOur regional win that year qualified us for the 2006 national competition in Atlanta, and the long haul from Connecticut was definitely worth it. The memories created there will be with the team forever. The UberBots also competed in Battlecry @ WPI in June, and Bash @ the Beach in October, an offseason event that we participate in to this day. The Bash @ the Beach was a great competition for our team because it allowed us to work in a competitive yet low-key environment with the new year''s team, as it takes place in October. We allied with teams 190 (Gompei Herd of Worchester, MA) and 500 (Waterford''s Team USA) and placed second.

The field was split into 3 sections by two 1-foot-tall bumps with tunnels in the middle, which allowed smaller robots to move between the sections without going over the bump. Robots were allowed to have kickers to kick the balls into 1 of the 2 goals per alliance at each corner of the field, for a total of 4 goals. Where the game stopped looking like soccer was at the end, where teams could climb up towers in the middle of the field for bonus points.\n\nWe knew we wanted our robot to be light, small, and maneuverable so we could quickly score as many soccer balls as possible, and so that we could move between sections of the field via the tunnels. In past years, we had always built our robot to do everything that it could. However, this year, because hanging was only worth 2 points, and soccer balls scored were worth 1 each, we decided that it made more sense to focus on scoring over hanging. Our robot, Striker, used a new drive system for us which gave each wheel a separate motor used window motors to turn the front and back wheels together. This allowed us to make tight turns and maneuver past defending robots to score. Though we built a pneumatic kicker that was quite effective, we mostly scored by "herding" or rolling soccer balls into the goals.\n\nThe UberBots had big plans for the 2010 season. Not only were we going to compete at 2 regionals for the first time ever, but we were planning to go for the Chairman''s Award. The Chairman''s award is the most prestigious Award given out by FIRST, to a team that spreads the message of FIRST, appreciation of science and technology, throughout their community. We had participated in many demos at schools and public places, and put together a video and an essay for the application.\n\nOur first regional was the WPI Regional. It was an early competition, so many teams, including us, were not in our prime. We only made it to the quarterfinals, where we were eliminated. However, we won the Chairman''s Award at WPI, even if we didn''t make it to the semifinals. We also won the Delphi Engineering Excellence Award for our robot''s elegant and simple design. The WPI Regional ended up going great, and it was good practice for our next event.\n\nThe Connecticut Regional was a fantastic event for the UberBots in 2010. We went undefeated throughout seeding and elimination matches, winning the competition on an alliance with Team 102 (The Gearheads) and Team 383 (Brazilian Machine). Since our robot was offensive, we scored high and also won the Coopertition award, which calculated points based on both our score and our opponents'' score after each match. We had also helped numerous teams on other alliances during the competition, which is part of the Coopertition award. Because of our complex drive system which allowed us to switch between a swerve drive for tight turns, a rotated drive for kicking, and other modes, we were again awarded the Rockwell Innovation in Control Award.\n\nThe UberBots again went to Atlanta to compete in the Championship. The competition was intense, and we were eliminated in the quarter finals of our division. However, we still placed well overall because our robot was able to score many balls quickly.\n\nWith many of our members outgoing seniors, and the loss of our practice spaces on the horizon, the UberBots were looking forward to a challenging 2011 season...<br>'),

A switchbox is basically a box with switches and LEDs. A green LED shines when the switch is on and a red LED shines when the switch is off. There are many usually many switches in a row. Additionally, each switch is connected to a Digital Input/Output (DIO) on a controller that reads "1" when the switch is on and "0" when the switch is off. This way, inputs can be passed to the robot, and the LEDs indicate the state of the switch to the driver.\n\nSwitchboxes may be connected to the Cypress FirstTouch PSoC 3 (which is connected to the operator console) or may be connected directly to the digital sidecar, setting configurations on the robot, such as for autonomous mode. Either way, the switchbox requires one DIO for each switch, a power source (VDD), and ground (VSS). Each switch requires either two LEDS or a biLED (three pins and can shine two different colors), a 1KÎ© resistor (a pulldown for the LEDs), a 10KÎ© resistor (a pullup for the DIO signal), and a single pole, double throw toggle switch (one common connects to one of two poles depending on its position). This list also assumes a lot of wires.\n\nSwitchboxes work well mounted inside a plastic (ABS) project box from RadioShack. If you''re using it with the PSoc, you may want to find a box that can hold the PSoC inside. The top can be drilled or milled in a CNC machine.\n\nNotice that one 1KÎ© resistor is used for every two LEDs (or one biLED, if you wish). If the two LEDs are going to run simultaneously, this is bad practice and should not be done. However, since the switch will only allow one LED to run at a time, using only one resistor is safe and advisable.\n\nThe schematic at right shows a four-switch switchbox. However, it should be easy to scale to whatever size is necessary. The "+5V" doesn''t need to be exactly 5 volts. The 3.3 volts on the PSoC or the 6 volts on the sidecar should work fine. However, you may want to scale the pulldown resistors using Ohm''s law to ensure an appropriate voltage goes through the LEDs. I found the LEDs should be have about 3 milliamps flowing through them.'),

The OmniCore will find the correct page in the database, and return all of the content associated with that page. Having pages stored in the database makes it very easy to create pages, modify their properties, and delete them. Below is the form for creating a page.\n<img src=''http://uberbots.org/omni/media/embedded/addPage.png'' alt=''add page form'' style="border:1px solid #CCC"/><br/><a href="#top">Top of Page</a></p>\n\n<h2 id="modules">Modules</h2>\n<p><img src=''http://uberbots.org/omni/media/embedded/editbox.png'' alt=''edit page dropdown box'' style="float:right;padding-left:5px;"/>Adding and modifying content on a page is very easy to do, and does not require knowledge of HTML or PHP. To add a module, the user simply needs to click the edit button at the top of the page and select "Add Module." The user then picks which module type to add and selects it. <br/>Modules are also very easy to edit. And administrator simply has to select "Edit Module" from the drop down box and select the module to edit. Then, a graphical method of editing the module will appear, as determined in the module PHP file. Once the edit has been made, the new information will be updated in the database.<br/>Administrators also have the ability to review edits made to a module. They can view past states of modules and revert to that state if necessary. All edits are stored in the database along with other information related to that edit, including the user, time, IP, and previous content. <br/>\nThis ability to easily edit content on the site is very important. It makes it so editing and maintaining the website is no longer a role for someone who knows HTML. Now, the website content is no longer directly tied to the source file, making for an easily modifiable and modular experience. <br/><a href="#top">Top of Page</a>\n</p>\n\n<h2 id="skins">Skins</h2>\n<p>The OmniPage system is also a skinnable system. The ability to use skins makes it much easier to change the website''s design. Previously, the programmers would have to completely change how the site works in the very low level files in order to change the formatting. With the OmniPage skin system, changing how the site looks is simply a matter of editing a skin file. Skin files are HTML, CSS, and Javascript files that manage how the site appears to the user. These files are passed dynamic content through the module files via special functions. This content is then displayed in the skin and shown to the end user. Now, when the website team would like to change how the site looks, they simply have to create a new skin with all the necessary files, instead of recoding the site. Skins can also be used to provide a dynamic viewing experience. A special skin can be used to simply shake things up or to make the site mobile device friendly. Either way, the ability to have skins is an important feature of the OmniPage system.<br/><a href="#top">Top of Page</a></p>\n\n<h2 id="communication">Communication</h2>\n<p><a href="http://facebook.com/TheUberBots"><img src="http://uberbots.org/omni/media/embedded/facebook.png" style="float:right;padding-left:5px;"/></a>\nThe OmniPage system also integrates communication with team members into its architecture. There is native support for emailing all team members, as well as other groups of users (as determined through the forums). The website also supports sending out mass SMS messages to those who signed up. The website will automatically send out a mass SMS 24 hours before any event on the calendar, ensuring team members are informed about upcoming events. These features come in handy for alerting team members to news regarding the team.<br/>\nThe OmniCore is also integrated with social networking. The UberBots <a href=''http://twitter.com/team1124''>Twitter</a> Account and <a href="http://facebook.com/TheUberBots">Facebook</a> fanpage are linked to the website, making it easy to update both.<br/><a href="http://twitter.com/team1124"><img src="http://uberbots.org/omni/media/embedded/twitter.png" /></a><br/><a href="#top">Top of Page</a></p>\n\n<h2 id="security">Security</h2>\n<p>The OmniPage also has native security features. All user accounts are integrated with the UberBots phpBB <a href="http://uberbots.org/forums">forums</a>. Having this integration removes the hassle of team members having multiple accounts (for both main site and forums), a problem with the previous website. This system creates an "all in one" user account for the entire UberBots website. <br/>Using the forums accounts also provides simple security features. PhpBB has native usergroups, which the OmniCore uses to decide whether a user can see or edit a certain page. Some groups have global permissions while others can only deal with certain pages. Administrators also have the ability to give certain users or groups special permissions (that aren''t native) for certain pages. This helps with maintaining website content; now any user can be responsible for a certain page and make sure it''s up to date. This system also ensures security with regard to editing content.<br/>\nThe OmniPage system also has native log features. When an administrative action is carried out, the system will automatically append an entry to a log text file with important information regarding the edit. Username, time, and the action are recorded. This record of events helps ensure security with administrative features.<br/><a href="#top">Top of Page</a></p>\n'),

Though we thought we may have over-extended ourselves, everyone was supportive and helped make last-minute changes at competition. After our final seeding match we were ranked 34th, but teams 177 (Bobcat Robotics of South Windsor) and 176 (Aces High from Suffield and Windsor Locks High Schools) had faith in our team and chose us to be their alliance partner. With a lot of team work and a little luck, the UberBots and our alliance partners battled our way to the top to win the UTC New England regional.\n\nOur regional win that year qualified us for the 2006 national competition in Atlanta, and the long haul from Connecticut was definitely worth it. The memories created there will be with the team forever. The UberBots also competed in Battlecry @ WPI in June, and Bash @ the Beach in October, an offseason event that we participate in to this day. The Bash @ the Beach was a great competition for our team because it allowed us to work in a competitive yet low-key environment with the new year''s team, as it takes place in October. We allied with teams 190 (Gompei Herd of Worchester, MA) and 500 (Waterford''s Team USA) and placed second. We also received an "All Business" award commending "the team that is most serious about their robotics and their fun."\n'),

Our robot, which we named "Dynamite" included a 2-joint arm (with a "wrist" and "shoulder" motor and a gripper for a hand) which gave us great flexibility since we could both score by putting tubes on the rack and get points back by removing "spoiler" game pieces. Dynamite also had a set of deployable ramps long enough to hold two robots, which earned us bonus points. Dynamite also had hefty bumpers that allowed us to play defense if we needed to, and an autonomous mode with 16 different functions that allowed us to automatically raise Dynamite''s arm to different heights and other useful things.\n\nWe were able to "Rack ''n'' Roll" our way to the top, finishing as an alliance captain (in the top 8), and we ultimately won the UTC Connecticut Regional with team 195 (the CyberKnights of Southington) and team 558 (the RoboSquad from New Haven). For the second year in a row, we traveled to Atlanta to compete in the nationals, ending up in the Newton division again. This time, however, we were ranked third after the division seeding matches, and allied with  teams 1592 (the Bionic Tigers from Cocoa, FL) and 1816 (The Green Machine, all the way from Edina, Minnesota!). Our powerful alliance brought us all the way to the division finals. The UberBots continued to Einstein as the backup bot for Newton''s champion. After the Championship, we competed at Battlecry @ WPI, hosted by team 190, where we seeded 1st for the first time ever.<br>'),

Teams could also earn points by "hurdling" the track balls over the 9-foot "overpass" in the middle of the field. The field was divided the long way down the center to give it a race-track feel. We responded to these aspects of the game in many ways as we designed and built our robot that year, Lightning.\n<br>\n<br>\nWe gave Lightning a two-speed transmission so that we could have both the speed to make it around the track and the precision to pick up the large track balls. To pick up and handle the large balls, we gave Lightning a 2-joint arm and a claw that could expand to wrap around the ball, then contract to keep possession of the ball as we moved around the field.\n<br>\n<br>\nWe built a second robot and a replica of the field in the space donated to us by Reflexite so that we could practice driving even after we had shipped our robot off after build season. We attended the Suffield Shakedown 2008 Scrimmage hosted by Team 176, Aces High. The competition was good practice for the new 2008 season''s team, and it let us see how other teams had tackled the challenges of the game. Allied with team 230 (the Gaelhawks) and team 1784 (the Litchbots), we won the scrimmage undefeated. Our team was also successful off the field, winning the spirit award for the first time ever. We were looking forward to how we would fare at the Connecticut regional.\n<br>\n<br>\nAt the Connecticut Regional, we won all our qualification matches, allied with numerous other great teams, and placed first in seeding among the 62 teams at the competition. This was a mark of progress for our team, as only two years ago we had had to fix our robot after every match. For the elimination matches, we allied with team 175 (Buzz Robotics) and team 716 (the Who''s-C-Teks). Through the quarterfinals, semifinals, and finals, our alliance went undefeated, winning the Connecticut Regional. During the award ceremony, we were honored with the Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers Entrepreneurship Award, recognizing our work in the community.\n<br>\n<br>\nIn 2008, the UberBots also competed in the Championship in Atlanta. In qualification, we achieved a 6-1 record, becoming the captains of the third alliance. We invited teams 1024 and 177 to be part of our alliance, creating a well-rounded team that could handle any situation on the field. Our alliance won in the quarterfinals and the semifinals, leading us to the finals where we faced another strong alliance captained by team 987. With past world champions and multiple regional winners on both sides, the competition was intense, but our alliance pulled through to become the champions of the Archimedes field. We advanced to the Einstein field, where we played teams who had advanced from other divisions. Our alliance faced even tougher competition there, but we became international semifinalists. 2008 was a great year for the UberBots. We went undefeated in all our regionals, and advanced all the way to the world semifinals in Atlanta.\n<br>'),

Robots could only use special, slippery wheels, and they competed on a slippery surface of white, plasticky material called "regolith." The game was designed to simulate low gravity conditions in a lunar environment. To continue the theme, the gamepieces were small, light balls called "moonrocks." Robots started the game possessing up to 7 moonrocks, and many more were strewn throughout the field. Human players outside the field threw moonrocks at the trailers attached to each robot to score. Robots could also score on other robots by putting moonrocks into their opponents'' robots'' trailers.\n<br>\n<br>\nWe built our robot, Vortex, around possessing as many moonrocks as possible and being able to score them from a range. The main body had a sweeper that swept moonrocks into a spiral, which fed them up to the cannon. The cannon was aimed by a camera, which tracked the vision targets on the opposing alliance''s trailers. Our systems team also created a sophisticated traction control system with encoders to minimize slippage on the slick field. As the competition progressed we modified our cannon to allow us to quickly dump multiple moon rocks into opponents'' trailers at close range.\n<br>\n<br>\nAfter a tough build season, our first event was the Suffield Shakedown, hosted by Aces High team 176, which we won on an alliance with teams 195 and 126. After that event, we competed in the Connecticut Regional. Although we didn''t make it as far as we had in previous years, we won the Rockwell Automation Innovation in Control Award for our traction control system and autonomous mode.\n<br>\n<br>\nAs with every past year, we competed in Atlanta, Georgia, in the Championship. The competition was great and a lot of fun, and we managed to make it to the quarterfinals on the Galileo Field, where we were eliminated by the alliance that went on to win the entire Championship.'),

The field was split into 3 sections by two 1-foot-tall bumps with tunnels in the middle, which allowed smaller robots to move between the sections without going over the bump. Robots were allowed to have kickers to kick the balls into 1 of the 2 goals per alliance at each corner of the field, for a total of 4 goals. Where the game stopped looking like soccer was at the end, where teams could climb up towers in the middle of the field for bonus points.\n\nWe knew we wanted our robot to be light, small, and maneuverable so we could quickly score as many soccer balls as possible, and so that we could move between sections of the field via the tunnels. In past years, we had always built our robot to do everything that it could. However, this year, because hanging was only worth 2 points, and soccer balls scored were worth 1 each, we decided that it made more sense to focus on scoring over hanging. Our robot, Striker, used a new drive system for us which gave each wheel a separate motor used window motors to turn the front and back wheels together. This allowed us to make tight turns and maneuver past defending robots to score. Though we built a pneumatic kicker that was quite effective, we mostly scored by "herding" or rolling soccer balls into the goals.\n\nThe UberBots had big plans for the 2010 season. Not only were we going to compete at 2 regionals for the first time ever, but we were planning to go for the Chairman''s Award. The Chairman''s award is the most prestigious Award given out by FIRST, to a team that spreads the message of FIRST, appreciation of science and technology, throughout their community. We had participated in many demos at schools and public places, and put together a video and an essay for the application.\n\nOur first regional was the WPI Regional. It was an early competition, so many teams, including us, were not in our prime. We only made it to the quarterfinals, where we were eliminated. However, we won the Chairman''s Award at WPI, even if we didn''t make it to the semifinals. We also won the Delphi Engineering Excellence Award for our robot''s elegant and simple design. The WPI Regional ended up going great, and it was good practice for our next event.\n\nThe Connecticut Regional was a fantastic event for the UberBots in 2010. We went undefeated throughout seeding and elimination matches, winning the competition on an alliance with Team 102 (The Gearheads) and Team 383 (Brazilian Machine). Since our robot was offensive, we scored high and also won the Coopertition award, which calculated points based on both our score and our opponents'' score after each match. We had also helped numerous teams on other alliances during the competition, which is part of the Coopertition award. Because of our complex drive system which allowed us to switch between a swerve drive for tight turns, a rotated drive for kicking, and other modes, we were again awarded the Rockwell Innovation in Control Award.\n\nThe UberBots again went to Atlanta to compete in the Championship. The competition was intense, and we were eliminated in the quarter finals of our division. However, we still placed well overall because our robot was able to score many balls quickly.\n\nWith many of our members outgoing seniors, and the loss of our practice spaces on the horizon, the UberBots were looking forward to a challenging 2011 season...<br>'),

(1207, 'code', '[h1]Overview of OmniPage[/h1]\n     The OmniPage system is an easily modifiable architecture for having an easily editable and modifiable website. The OmniPage system is written in [url=http://php.net]PHP[/url], with extensive use of [url=http://mysql.com]mySQL[/url]. The PHP files are integrated with the mySQL database, where they can get any content needed, as all of the website''s dynamic data and content is stored in that database. Formatting for the entire site is done in [url=http://w3.org/Style/CSS/]CSS[/url], to make a uniform style.\n\n     Pages and their content is also stored in the database. Content is output to the site in the form of [url=http://uberbots.org/o/about/our_website/advantages#modules]modules[/url], which are on [url=http://uberbots.org/o/about/our_website/advantages#pages]pages[/url]. A module is a predefined block of code that can be placed anywhere on the site to serve its purpose. This creates a "drag and drop" effect with code chunks, making it easy to put content on the site. Different modules serve different purposes. For example, the HTML module will output parsed HTML that the user input. The [url=http://bbcode.org]bbCode[/url] module will output parsed bbCode, a safe and simple way to provide formatting, commonly used on web forums.\n\n     The OmniPage system is also a skinnable engine. In order to change how the site looks, the website team simply has to create a new skin, or a different way of outputting content generated by modules. This gives the webmaster the ability to completely redesign the website without recoding it, or simply make a different way to view it, such as on mobile browsers. More information on skins can be found [url=http://uberbots.org/o/about/our_website/advantages#skins]here[/url].\n\n     The OmniPage system is also a secure system with dynamic and powerful user privileges. It is based off of phpBB''s permission system, which utilizes usergroups to make large scale permissions simple. More information on security can be found [url=http://uberbots.org/o/about/our_website/advantages#security]here[/url].\n\n     All in all, the OmniPage system is a very powerful website engine and CMS that was designed with simplicity and power in mind.'),

Though we thought we may have over-extended ourselves, everyone was supportive and helped make last-minute changes at competition. After our final seeding match we were ranked 34th, but teams 177 (Bobcat Robotics of South Windsor) and 176 (Aces High from Suffield and Windsor Locks High Schools) had faith in our team and chose us to be their alliance partner. With a lot of team work and a little luck, the UberBots and our alliance partners battled our way to the top to win the UTC New England regional.\n\nOur regional win that year qualified us for the 2006 national competition in Atlanta, and the long haul from Connecticut was definitely worth it. The memories created there will be with the team forever. The UberBots also competed in Battlecry @ WPI in June, and Bash @ the Beach in October, an offseason event that we participate in to this day. The Bash @ the Beach was a great competition for our team because it allowed us to work in a competitive yet low-key environment with the new year''s team, as it takes place in October. We allied with teams 190 (Gompei Herd of Worchester, MA) and 500 (Waterford''s Team USA) and placed second. We also received an "All Business" award commending "the team that is most serious about their robotics and their fun."\n'),

Our robot, which we named "Dynamite" included a 2-joint arm (with a "wrist" and "shoulder" motor and a gripper for a hand) which gave us great flexibility since we could both score by putting tubes on the rack and get points back by removing "spoiler" game pieces. Dynamite also had a set of deployable ramps long enough to hold two robots, which earned us bonus points. Dynamite also had hefty bumpers that allowed us to play defense if we needed to, and an autonomous mode with 16 different functions that allowed us to automatically raise Dynamite''s arm to different heights and other useful things.\n\nWe were able to "Rack ''n'' Roll" our way to the top, finishing as an alliance captain (in the top 8), and we ultimately won the UTC Connecticut Regional with team 195 (the CyberKnights of Southington) and team 558 (the RoboSquad from New Haven). For the second year in a row, we traveled to Atlanta to compete in the nationals, ending up in the Newton division again. This time, however, we were ranked third after the division seeding matches, and allied with  teams 1592 (the Bionic Tigers from Cocoa, FL) and 1816 (The Green Machine, all the way from Edina, Minnesota!). Our powerful alliance brought us all the way to the division finals. The UberBots continued to Einstein as the backup bot for Newton''s champion. After the Championship, we competed at Battlecry @ WPI, hosted by team 190, where we seeded 1st for the first time ever.<br>');

Teams could also earn points by "hurdling" the track balls over the 9-foot "overpass" in the middle of the field. The field was divided the long way down the center to give it a race-track feel. We responded to these aspects of the game in many ways as we designed and built our robot that year, Lightning.\n<br>\n<br>\nWe gave Lightning a two-speed transmission so that we could have both the speed to make it around the track and the precision to pick up the large track balls. To pick up and handle the large balls, we gave Lightning a 2-joint arm and a claw that could expand to wrap around the ball, then contract to keep possession of the ball as we moved around the field.\n<br>\n<br>\nWe built a second robot and a replica of the field in the space donated to us by Reflexite so that we could practice driving even after we had shipped our robot off after build season. We attended the Suffield Shakedown 2008 Scrimmage hosted by Team 176, Aces High. The competition was good practice for the new 2008 season''s team, and it let us see how other teams had tackled the challenges of the game. Allied with team 230 (the Gaelhawks) and team 1784 (the Litchbots), we won the scrimmage undefeated. Our team was also successful off the field, winning the spirit award for the first time ever. We were looking forward to how we would fare at the Connecticut regional.\n<br>\n<br>\nAt the Connecticut Regional, we won all our qualification matches, allied with numerous other great teams, and placed first in seeding among the 62 teams at the competition. This was a mark of progress for our team, as only two years ago we had had to fix our robot after every match. For the elimination matches, we allied with team 175 (Buzz Robotics) and team 716 (the Who''s-C-Teks). Through the quarterfinals, semifinals, and finals, our alliance went undefeated, winning the Connecticut Regional. During the award ceremony, we were honored with the Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers Entrepreneurship Award, recognizing our work in the community.\n<br>\n<br>\nIn 2008, the UberBots also competed in the Championship in Atlanta. In qualification, we achieved a 6-1 record, becoming the captains of the third alliance. We invited teams 1024 and 177 to be part of our alliance, creating a well-rounded team that could handle any situation on the field. Our alliance won in the quarterfinals and the semifinals, leading us to the finals where we faced another strong alliance captained by team 987. With past world champions and multiple regional winners on both sides, the competition was intense, but our alliance pulled through to become the champions of the Archimedes field. We advanced to the Einstein field, where we played teams who had advanced from other divisions. Our alliance faced even tougher competition there, but we became international semifinalists. 2008 was a great year for the UberBots. We went undefeated in all our regionals, and advanced all the way to the world semifinals in Atlanta.\n<br>'),

Robots could only use special, slippery wheels, and they competed on a slippery surface of white, plasticky material called "regolith." The game was designed to simulate low gravity conditions in a lunar environment. To continue the theme, the gamepieces were small, light balls called "moonrocks." Robots started the game possessing up to 7 moonrocks, and many more were strewn throughout the field. Human players outside the field threw moonrocks at the trailers attached to each robot to score. Robots could also score on other robots by putting moonrocks into their opponents'' robots'' trailers.\n<br>\n<br>\nWe built our robot, Vortex, around possessing as many moonrocks as possible and being able to score them from a range. The main body had a sweeper that swept moonrocks into a spiral, which fed them up to the cannon. The cannon was aimed by a camera, which tracked the vision targets on the opposing alliance''s trailers. Our systems team also created a sophisticated traction control system with encoders to minimize slippage on the slick field. As the competition progressed we modified our cannon to allow us to quickly dump multiple moon rocks into opponents'' trailers at close range.\n<br>\n<br>\nAfter a tough build season, our first event was the Suffield Shakedown, hosted by Aces High team 176, which we won on an alliance with teams 195 and 126. After that event, we competed in the Connecticut Regional. Although we didn''t make it as far as we had in previous years, we won the Rockwell Automation Innovation in Control Award for our traction control system and autonomous mode.\n<br>\n<br>\nAs with every past year, we competed in Atlanta, Georgia, in the Championship. The competition was great and a lot of fun, and we managed to make it to the quarterfinals on the Galileo Field, where we were eliminated by the alliance that went on to win the entire Championship.'),

The field was split into 3 sections by two 1-foot-tall bumps with tunnels in the middle, which allowed smaller robots to move between the sections without going over the bump. Robots were allowed to have kickers to kick the balls into 1 of the 2 goals per alliance at each corner of the field, for a total of 4 goals. Where the game stopped looking like soccer was at the end, where teams could climb up towers in the middle of the field for bonus points.\n\nWe knew we wanted our robot to be light, small, and maneuverable so we could quickly score as many soccer balls as possible, and so that we could move between sections of the field via the tunnels. In past years, we had always built our robot to do everything that it could. However, this year, because hanging was only worth 2 points, and soccer balls scored were worth 1 each, we decided that it made more sense to focus on scoring over hanging. Our robot, Striker, used a new drive system for us which gave each wheel a separate motor used window motors to turn the front and back wheels together. This allowed us to make tight turns and maneuver past defending robots to score. Though we built a pneumatic kicker that was quite effective, we mostly scored by "herding" or rolling soccer balls into the goals.\n\nThe UberBots had big plans for the 2010 season. Not only were we going to compete at 2 regionals for the first time ever, but we were planning to go for the Chairman''s Award. The Chairman''s award is the most prestigious Award given out by FIRST, to a team that spreads the message of FIRST, appreciation of science and technology, throughout their community. We had participated in many demos at schools and public places, and put together a video and an essay for the application.\n\nOur first regional was the WPI Regional. It was an early competition, so many teams, including us, were not in our prime. We only made it to the quarterfinals, where we were eliminated. However, we won the Chairman''s Award at WPI, even if we didn''t make it to the semifinals. We also won the Delphi Engineering Excellence Award for our robot''s elegant and simple design. The WPI Regional ended up going great, and it was good practice for our next event.\n\nThe Connecticut Regional was a fantastic event for the UberBots in 2010. We went undefeated throughout seeding and elimination matches, winning the competition on an alliance with Team 102 (The Gearheads) and Team 383 (Brazilian Machine). Since our robot was offensive, we scored high and also won the Coopertition award, which calculated points based on both our score and our opponents'' score after each match. We had also helped numerous teams on other alliances during the competition, which is part of the Coopertition award. Because of our complex drive system which allowed us to switch between a swerve drive for tight turns, a rotated drive for kicking, and other modes, we were again awarded the Rockwell Innovation in Control Award.\n\nThe UberBots again went to Atlanta to compete in the Championship. The competition was intense, and we were eliminated in the quarter finals of our division. However, we still placed well overall because our robot was able to score many balls quickly.\n\nWith many of our members outgoing seniors, and the loss of our practice spaces on the horizon, the UberBots were looking forward to a challenging 2011 season...<br>'),

The field was split into 3 sections by two 1-foot-tall bumps with tunnels in the middle, which allowed smaller robots to move between the sections without going over the bump. Robots were allowed to have kickers to kick the balls into 1 of the 2 goals per alliance at each corner of the field, for a total of 4 goals. Where the game stopped looking like soccer was at the end, where teams could climb up towers in the middle of the field for bonus points.\n\nWe knew we wanted our robot to be light, small, and maneuverable so we could quickly score as many soccer balls as possible, and so that we could move between sections of the field via the tunnels. In past years, we had always built our robot to do everything that it could. However, this year, because hanging was only worth 2 points, and soccer balls scored were worth 1 each, we decided that it made more sense to focus on scoring over hanging. Our robot, Striker, used a new drive system for us which gave each wheel a separate motor used window motors to turn the front and back wheels together. This allowed us to make tight turns and maneuver past defending robots to score. Though we built a pneumatic kicker that was quite effective, we mostly scored by "herding" or rolling soccer balls into the goals.\n\nThe UberBots had big plans for the 2010 season. Not only were we going to compete at 2 regionals for the first time ever, but we were planning to go for the Chairman''s Award. The Chairman''s award is the most prestigious Award given out by FIRST, to a team that spreads the message of FIRST, appreciation of science and technology, throughout their community. We had participated in many demos at schools and public places, and put together a video and an essay for the application.\n\nOur first regional was the WPI Regional. It was an early competition, so many teams, including us, were not in our prime. We only made it to the quarterfinals, where we were eliminated. However, we won the Chairman''s Award at WPI, even if we didn''t make it to the semifinals. We also won the Delphi Engineering Excellence Award for our robot''s elegant and simple design. The WPI Regional ended up going great, and it was good practice for our next event.\n\nThe Connecticut Regional was a fantastic event for the UberBots in 2010. We went undefeated throughout seeding and elimination matches, winning the competition on an alliance with Team 102 (The Gearheads) and Team 383 (Brazilian Machine). Since our robot was offensive, we scored high and also won the Coopertition award, which calculated points based on both our score and our opponents'' score after each match. We had also helped numerous teams on other alliances during the competition, which is part of the Coopertition award. Because of our complex drive system which allowed us to switch between a swerve drive for tight turns, a rotated drive for kicking, and other modes, we were again awarded the Rockwell Innovation in Control Award.\n\nThe UberBots again went to Atlanta to compete in the Championship.

We had also helped numerous teams on other alliances during the competition, which is part of the Coopertition award.

Since our robot was offensive, we scored high and also won the Coopertition award, which calculated points based on both our score and our opponents'' score after each match. We had also helped numerous teams on other alliances during the competition, which is part of the Coopertition award. Because of our complex drive system which allowed us to switch between a swerve drive for tight turns, a rotated drive for kicking, and other modes, we were again awarded the Rockwell Innovation in Control Award.\n\nThe UberBots again went to Atlanta to compete in the Championship. The competition was intense, and we were eliminated in the quarter finals of our division. However, we still placed well overall because our robot was able to score many balls quickly.\n'),

Robots could only use special, slippery wheels, and they competed on a slippery surface of white, plasticky material called "regolith." The game was designed to simulate low gravity conditions in a lunar environment. To continue the theme, the gamepieces were small, light balls called "moonrocks." Robots started the game possessing up to 7 moonrocks, and many more were strewn throughout the field. Human players outside the field threw moonrocks at the trailers attached to each robot to score. Robots could also score on other robots by putting moonrocks into their opponents'' robots'' trailers.\n<br>\n<br>\nWe built our robot, Vortex, around possessing as many moonrocks as possible and being able to score them from a range. The main body had a sweeper that swept moonrocks into a spiral, which fed them up to the cannon. The cannon was aimed by a camera, which tracked the vision targets on the opposing alliance''s trailers. Our systems team also created a sophisticated traction control system with encoders to minimize slippage on the slick field. As the competition progressed we modified our cannon to allow us to quickly dump multiple moon rocks into opponents'' trailers at close range.\n<br>\n<br>\nAfter a tough build season, our first event was the Suffield Shakedown, hosted by Aces High team 176, which we won on an alliance with teams 195 and 126. After that event, we competed in the Connecticut Regional. Although we didn''t make it as far as we had in previous years, we won the Rockwell Automation Innovation in Control Award for our traction control system and autonomous mode.\n<br>\n<br>\nAs with every past year, we competed in Atlanta, Georgia, in the Championship. The competition was great and a lot of fun, and we managed to make it to the quarterfinals on the Galileo Field, where we were eliminated by the alliance that went on to win the entire Championship.'),

Teams could also earn points by "hurdling" the track balls over the 9-foot "overpass" in the middle of the field. The field was divided the long way down the center to give it a race-track feel. We responded to these aspects of the game in many ways as we designed and built our robot that year, Lightning.\n<br>\n<br>\nWe gave Lightning a two-speed transmission so that we could have both the speed to make it around the track and the precision to pick up the large track balls. To pick up and handle the large balls, we gave Lightning a 2-joint arm and a claw that could expand to wrap around the ball, then contract to keep possession of the ball as we moved around the field.\n<br>\n<br>\nWe built a second robot and a replica of the field in the space donated to us by Reflexite so that we could practice driving even after we had shipped our robot off after build season. We attended the Suffield Shakedown 2008 Scrimmage hosted by Team 176, Aces High. The competition was good practice for the new 2008 season''s team, and it let us see how other teams had tackled the challenges of the game. Allied with team 230 (the Gaelhawks) and team 1784 (the Litchbots), we won the scrimmage undefeated. Our team was also successful off the field, winning the spirit award for the first time ever. We were looking forward to how we would fare at the Connecticut regional.\n<br>\n<br>\nAt the Connecticut Regional, we won all our qualification matches, allied with numerous other great teams, and placed first in seeding among the 62 teams at the competition. This was a mark of progress for our team, as only two years ago we had had to fix our robot after every match. For the elimination matches, we allied with team 175 (Buzz Robotics) and team 716 (the Who''s-C-Teks). Through the quarterfinals, semifinals, and finals, our alliance went undefeated, winning the Connecticut Regional. During the award ceremony, we were honored with the Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers Entrepreneurship Award, recognizing our work in the community.\n<br>\n<br>\nIn 2008, the UberBots also competed in the Championship in Atlanta. In qualification, we achieved a 6-1 record, becoming the captains of the third alliance. We invited teams 1024 and 177 to be part of our alliance, creating a well-rounded team that could handle any situation on the field. Our alliance won in the quarterfinals and the semifinals, leading us to the finals where we faced another strong alliance captained by team 987. With past world champions and multiple regional winners on both sides, the competition was intense, but our alliance pulled through to become the champions of the Archimedes field. We advanced to the Einstein field, where we played teams who had advanced from other divisions. Our alliance faced even tougher competition there, but we became international semifinalists. 2008 was a great year for the UberBots. We went undefeated in all our regionals, and advanced all the way to the world semifinals in Atlanta.\n<br>'),

Our robot, which we named "Dynamite" included a 2-joint arm (with a "wrist" and "shoulder" motor and a gripper for a hand) which gave us great flexibility since we could both score by putting tubes on the rack and get points back by removing "spoiler" game pieces. Dynamite also had a set of deployable ramps long enough to hold two robots, which earned us bonus points. Dynamite also had hefty bumpers that allowed us to play defense if we needed to, and an autonomous mode with 16 different functions that allowed us to automatically raise Dynamite''s arm to different heights and other useful things.\n\nWe were able to "Rack ''n'' Roll" our way to the top, finishing as an alliance captain (in the top 8), and we ultimately won the UTC Connecticut Regional with team 195 (the CyberKnights of Southington) and team 558 (the RoboSquad from New Haven). For the second year in a row, we traveled to Atlanta to compete in the nationals, ending up in the Newton division again. This time, however, we were ranked third after the division seeding matches, and allied with  teams 1592 (the Bionic Tigers from Cocoa, FL) and 1816 (The Green Machine, all the way from Edina, Minnesota!). Our powerful alliance brought us all the way to the division finals. The UberBots continued to Einstein as the backup bot for Newton''s champion. After the Championship, we competed at Battlecry @ WPI, hosted by team 190, where we seeded 1st for the first time ever.<br>');

Teams could also earn points by "hurdling" the track balls over the 9-foot "overpass" in the middle of the field. The field was divided the long way down the center to give it a race-track feel. We responded to these aspects of the game in many ways as we designed and built our robot that year, Lightning.\n<br>\n<br>\nWe gave Lightning a two-speed transmission so that we could have both the speed to make it around the track and the precision to pick up the large track balls. To pick up and handle the large balls, we gave Lightning a 2-joint arm and a claw that could expand to wrap around the ball, then contract to keep possession of the ball as we moved around the field.\n<br>\n<br>\nWe built a second robot and a replica of the field in the space donated to us by Reflexite so that we could practice driving even after we had shipped our robot off after build season. We attended the Suffield Shakedown 2008 Scrimmage hosted by Team 176, Aces High. The competition was good practice for the new 2008 season''s team, and it let us see how other teams had tackled the challenges of the game. Allied with team 230 (the Gaelhawks) and team 1784 (the Litchbots), we won the scrimmage undefeated. Our team was also successful off the field, winning the spirit award for the first time ever. We were looking forward to how we would fare at the Connecticut regional.\n<br>\n<br>\nAt the Connecticut Regional, we won all our qualification matches, allied with numerous other great teams, and placed first in seeding among the 62 teams at the competition. This was a mark of progress for our team, as only two years ago we had had to fix our robot after every match. For the elimination matches, we allied with team 175 (Buzz Robotics) and team 716 (the Who''s-C-Teks). Through the quarterfinals, semifinals, and finals, our alliance went undefeated, winning the Connecticut Regional. During the award ceremony, we were honored with the Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers Entrepreneurship Award, recognizing our work in the community.\n<br>\n<br>\nIn 2008, the UberBots also competed in the Championship in Atlanta. In qualification, we achieved a 6-1 record, becoming the captains of the third alliance. We invited teams 1024 and 177 to be part of our alliance, creating a well-rounded team that could handle any situation on the field. Our alliance won in the quarterfinals and the semifinals, leading us to the finals where we faced another strong alliance captained by team 987. With past world champions and multiple regional winners on both sides, the competition was intense, but our alliance pulled through to become the champions of the Archimedes field. We advanced to the Einstein field, where we played teams who had advanced from other divisions. Our alliance faced even tougher competition there, but we became international semifinalists. 2008 was a great year for the UberBots. We went undefeated in all our regionals, and advanced all the way to the world semifinals in Atlanta.\n<br>'),

They are as follows:\n[list]\n[*][url=http://uberbots.org/o/Resources/For_FIRST_Teams/competitions/pit_crew]Pit Crew[/url]\nWorking in the pits (red), the pit crew is made up of 5-6 members of the team who are responsible for keeping the robot operational throughout the competition. Working in a confined environment, they must quickly and efficiently fix any problems and perform any maintenance necessary to keep the robot in peak operating conditions throughout the competition.\n[*][url=http://uberbots.org/o/Resources/For_FIRST_Teams/competitions/drive_team]Drive Team[/url]\nWorking both on the field (blue) and in the stands (green), the drive team consists of four members of the team which together are responsible for the operation of the robot during the game. They are preselected prior to competition, and generally consist of a main team and a backup. The four members of the team include a first and second driver, a coach and a human player. The drivers operate the robot, the coach acts as the brain, while the human player performs the necessary human-aided function of the game. Drive team members also have certain roles at the beginning and end of each match:\n[*][url=http://uberbots.org/o/Resources/For_FIRST_Teams/competitions/scouting]Scouting[/url]\nThe scouting team operates both in the stands (green) and in the pits (red) in order to gather information on the other teams in the competition. They are responsible for providing the coaches and drive team with information and suggestions prior to matches, and also for helping in alliance selections. The team usually consists of seven members - a lead scout and six subordinates.\n[*]Spirit\nThe spirit team operates in the stands (green), leading the team in cheering during matches and also spreading the team''s name throughout the stands through pins, bracelets and other objects.\n[/list]'),

A coach has to take into consideration the big picture of what''s happening on the entire field, the actions of our own robot, how our team cooperates with our alliance partners on the field to achieve our strategy, and be able to think quickly and revise strategies on his/her feet.\n\n\nWith this in mind, there are certain things to keep in mind that will help you to get the most out of the coaching process without getting overwhelmed. There is by no means one method that is the "ideal" way to coach a drive team, but each individual preference is based off of the general tips listed below.

It shows that you have confidence. Inter-alliance communication is essential, so make sure that all the coaches are communicating smoothly during the match - the last thing that the alliance needs is three robots doing their own thing during the match.

Despite that all, make sure to stay focused on the prize. Before each match, breath in deep through the nose and exhale through the mouth to focus your mind. Never panic - Even if you''re really getting crushed, panicing doesnt do anything. Instead, stay calm and make sure your nerves dont get ahead of your brain. You never know, the other team could get penalized or you could make a comback (we''ve done that plenty of times before)\n\n[*][b]Stay positive and motivated.[/b]\nOnce you get into the mindset that there''s no hope, you have less motivation, and you start acting on that. There''s always a chance to turn game play around. It''s not over ''til it''s over. Also, try to do your best to keep your other team mates motivated and focused. A pair of tired drivers isn''t going to win a round, make sure they''re motivated and ready to go.\n\n[*][b]Be prepared to make mistakes, then remember what you learned.[/b]\nAs coach, you are the one responsible if something goes wrong, and only share in the glory when you win (sounds like a great job, right?) And believe me, even the best coaches (cough, cough) make mistakes and we have to be prepared to face the team when it happens. Did you learn something crucial about another team, a rule or a strategy? Make sure you take note of it so you remember it for later.\n\n[*][b]Be ready to think on your feet; go with your gut.[/b]\nThings change, the unexpected happens.

You don''t have to stick to your initial plan if things come up preventing it. Whatever you do, do something. Standing there gaping at the field certainly will not score you any more points. Go with your gut - The game is only around 2 minutes long, you dont have time to make long calculated decisions. By the time you''ve been on stage a few times, you should know what feels right or wrong to do. Sometimes it''s not mathematically the best answer, but it will pay dividends in the end.\n\n[*][b]Keep the entire team motivated.[/b]\nAs coach, you are the figurehead of the entire competition.

This causes inefficiencies that could be detrimental to the team. So, when the coach hear''s about any problems, they should resolve them instead of letting them boil out of control. You dont want a "Lord of the Flies" situation happening within the team.

(1401, 'code', '[h1]Team Structure[/h1]\n\nMaintaining a team requires a mixture of freedom and structure. Mentors and students comprise the active members that give the life and workforce to a team. The UberBots are run by a student-run Management Subteam. (One may notice I capitalized Management. This is because the word has gained such a proper-noun meaning within our team.)\n\nCurrently, the subteam is comprised of a President, Vice President, Secretary, Treasurer, and Community Liaison. The President is primarily the representative of the team when a singular presence is required and leads Management in its operations. The Vice President is second in command and presumes the President''s responsibilities when he or she isn''t available. In addition, the Vice President assists the other positions and fills in gaps in the team where needed. The secretary is in charge of taking meeting-minutes, attendance, keeping the calendar up to date, team communication, and collects forms and permission slips. The treasurer maintains the budget, deals with mentors to distribute funds, and collects and manages money. Our least self-explanitory position, however, is Community Liaison. He or she (along with the President) represents the team to the community and the outside world and leads the community team. He is responsible for the scheduling planning of fundraisers and demos, and leads those events. The Community Liaison also leads the community team and the Chairman''s Award Team.\n\nThe Management Team is elected each year after the Championships (Atlanta/St. Louis). Members are nominated (or self nominated) for each position and from there we hold platforms and debates. Then each team member (including Seniors) casts one secret vote for each position, and one mentor tallies the ballots and announces the winners. Over the summer, the new Management works hard to prepare the team for the upcoming year. \n\nManagement works closely and meets regularly along with the team coach or mentors. They are generally responsible for making most decisions (except for regarding safety and money) and may be advised in their decisions by mentors. For example, if somebody on the team want to make a purchase, the treasurer is notified, who tells the management team, who decide whether or not to make a purchase, and if they decide to do so, go to the Coach for final approval.\n\nBelow Management, the team is divided into other subteams. Currently, we have a Systems Team, Mechanical Team, CAD Team, Website Team, and Community Team. The Systems Team programs and works with electronics. The Mechanical Team works on the physical and machinery aspects of the robot. The CAD Team models the robot on CAD programs and the Autodesk Award. The Website Team designs and maintains the website and prepares it for the Website Award. The Community Team works with the Community Liaison to plan demos and work on the Chairman''s Award. Students may pick to work with a specific subteam because of interests and skills, but are in no way restricted to staying with one subteam or stopped from taking part in a subteam.'),

For the rest of the match, drivers control robots and try to maximize their alliance score by hanging as many logo pieces as possible. Any logo piece hung on the same peg as an Ubertube receives double points. If teams assemble the logo pieces on their scoring grids to form the FIRSTÃ‚Â® logo (triangle, circle, square, in a horizontal row in that order), the points for the entire row are doubled.\nThe match ends with robots deploying minibots, small electro-mechanical assemblies that are independent of the host robot, onto vertical poles.

Though we thought we may have over-extended ourselves, everyone was supportive and helped make last-minute changes at competition. After our final seeding match we were ranked 34th, but teams 177 (Bobcat Robotics of South Windsor) and 176 (Aces High from Suffield and Windsor Locks High Schools) had faith in our team and chose us to be their alliance partner. With a lot of team work and a little luck, the UberBots and our alliance partners battled our way to the top to win the UTC New England regional.\n\nOur regional win that year qualified us for the 2006 national competition in Atlanta, and the long haul from Connecticut was definitely worth it. The memories created there will be with the team forever. The UberBots also competed in Battlecry @ WPI in June, and Bash @ the Beach in October, an offseason event that we participate in to this day. The Bash @ the Beach was a great competition for our team because it allowed us to work in a competitive yet low-key environment with the new year''s team, as it takes place in October. We allied with teams 190 (Gompei Herd of Worchester, MA) and 500 (Waterford''s Team USA) and placed second. We also received an "All Business" award commending "the team that is most serious about their robotics and their fun."\n'),

Our robot, which we named "Dynamite" included a 2-joint arm (with a "wrist" and "shoulder" motor and a gripper for a hand) which gave us great flexibility since we could both score by putting tubes on the rack and get points back by removing "spoiler" game pieces. Dynamite also had a set of deployable ramps long enough to hold two robots, which earned us bonus points. Dynamite also had hefty bumpers that allowed us to play defense if we needed to, and an autonomous mode with 16 different functions that allowed us to automatically raise Dynamite''s arm to different heights and other useful things.\n\nWe were able to "Rack ''n'' Roll" our way to the top, finishing as an alliance captain (in the top 8), and we ultimately won the UTC Connecticut Regional with team 195 (the CyberKnights of Southington) and team 558 (the RoboSquad from New Haven). For the second year in a row, we traveled to Atlanta to compete in the nationals, ending up in the Newton division again. This time, however, we were ranked third after the division seeding matches, and allied with  teams 1592 (the Bionic Tigers from Cocoa, FL) and 1816 (The Green Machine, all the way from Edina, Minnesota!).

Our robot, which we named "Dynamite" included a 2-joint arm (with a "wrist" and "shoulder" motor and a gripper for a hand) which gave us great flexibility since we could both score by putting tubes on the rack and get points back by removing "spoiler" game pieces. Dynamite also had a set of deployable ramps long enough to hold two robots, which earned us bonus points. Dynamite also had hefty bumpers that allowed us to play defense if we needed to, and an autonomous mode with 16 different functions that allowed us to automatically raise Dynamite''s arm to different heights and other useful things.\n\nWe were able to "Rack ''n'' Roll" our way to the top, finishing as an alliance captain (in the top 8), and we ultimately won the UTC Connecticut Regional with team 195 (the CyberKnights of Southington) and team 558 (the RoboSquad from New Haven). For the second year in a row, we traveled to Atlanta to compete in the nationals, ending up in the Newton division again. This time, however, we were ranked third after the division seeding matches, and allied with  teams 1592 (the Bionic Tigers from Cocoa, FL) and 1816 (The Green Machine, all the way from Edina, Minnesota!). Our powerful alliance brought us all the way to the division finals. The UberBots continued to Einstein as the backup bot for Newton''s champion.

Teams could also earn points by "hurdling" the track balls over the 9-foot "overpass" in the middle of the field. The field was divided the long way down the center to give it a race-track feel. We responded to these aspects of the game in many ways as we designed and built our robot that year, Lightning.\n<br>\n<br>\nWe gave Lightning a two-speed transmission so that we could have both the speed to make it around the track and the precision to pick up the large track balls. To pick up and handle the large balls, we gave Lightning a 2-joint arm and a claw that could expand to wrap around the ball, then contract to keep possession of the ball as we moved around the field.\n<br>\n<br>\nWe built a second robot and a replica of the field in the space donated to us by Reflexite so that we could practice driving even after we had shipped our robot off after build season. We attended the Suffield Shakedown 2008 Scrimmage hosted by Team 176, Aces High. The competition was good practice for the new 2008 season''s team, and it let us see how other teams had tackled the challenges of the game. Allied with team 230 (the Gaelhawks) and team 1784 (the Litchbots), we won the scrimmage undefeated. Our team was also successful off the field, winning the spirit award for the first time ever. We were looking forward to how we would fare at the Connecticut regional.\n<br>\n<br>\nAt the Connecticut Regional, we won all our qualification matches, allied with numerous other great teams, and placed first in seeding among the 62 teams at the competition. This was a mark of progress for our team, as only two years ago we had had to fix our robot after every match. For the elimination matches, we allied with team 175 (Buzz Robotics) and team 716 (the Who''s-C-Teks). Through the quarterfinals, semifinals, and finals, our alliance went undefeated, winning the Connecticut Regional. During the award ceremony, we were honored with the Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers Entrepreneurship Award, recognizing our work in the community.\n<br>\n<br>\nIn 2008, the UberBots also competed in the Championship in Atlanta. In qualification, we achieved a 6-1 record, becoming the captains of the third alliance. We invited teams 1024 and 177 to be part of our alliance, creating a well-rounded team that could handle any situation on the field. Our alliance won in the quarterfinals and the semifinals, leading us to the finals where we faced another strong alliance captained by team 987. With past world champions and multiple regional winners on both sides, the competition was intense, but our alliance pulled through to become the champions of the Archimedes field. We advanced to the Einstein field, where we played teams who had advanced from other divisions. Our alliance faced even tougher competition there, but we became international semifinalists. 2008 was a great year for the UberBots. We went undefeated in all our regionals, and advanced all the way to the world semifinals in Atlanta.\n<br>'),

Robots could only use special, slippery wheels, and they competed on a slippery surface of white, plasticky material called "regolith." The game was designed to simulate low gravity conditions in a lunar environment. To continue the theme, the gamepieces were small, light balls called "moonrocks." Robots started the game possessing up to 7 moonrocks, and many more were strewn throughout the field. Human players outside the field threw moonrocks at the trailers attached to each robot to score. Robots could also score on other robots by putting moonrocks into their opponents'' robots'' trailers.\n<br>\n<br>\nWe built our robot, Vortex, around possessing as many moonrocks as possible and being able to score them from a range. The main body had a sweeper that swept moonrocks into a spiral, which fed them up to the cannon. The cannon was aimed by a camera, which tracked the vision targets on the opposing alliance''s trailers. Our systems team also created a sophisticated traction control system with encoders to minimize slippage on the slick field. As the competition progressed we modified our cannon to allow us to quickly dump multiple moon rocks into opponents'' trailers at close range.\n<br>\n<br>\nAfter a tough build season, our first event was the Suffield Shakedown, hosted by Aces High team 176, which we won on an alliance with teams 195 and 126. After that event, we competed in the Connecticut Regional. Although we didn''t make it as far as we had in previous years, we won the Rockwell Automation Innovation in Control Award for our traction control system and autonomous mode.\n<br>\n<br>\nAs with every past year, we competed in Atlanta, Georgia, in the Championship. The competition was great and a lot of fun, and we managed to make it to the quarterfinals on the Galileo Field, where we were eliminated by the alliance that went on to win the entire Championship.'),

The field was split into 3 sections by two 1-foot-tall bumps with tunnels in the middle, which allowed smaller robots to move between the sections without going over the bump. Robots were allowed to have kickers to kick the balls into 1 of the 2 goals per alliance at each corner of the field, for a total of 4 goals. Where the game stopped looking like soccer was at the end, where teams could climb up towers in the middle of the field for bonus points.\n\nWe knew we wanted our robot to be light, small, and maneuverable so we could quickly score as many soccer balls as possible, and so that we could move between sections of the field via the tunnels. In past years, we had always built our robot to do everything that it could. However, this year, because hanging was only worth 2 points, and soccer balls scored were worth 1 each, we decided that it made more sense to focus on scoring over hanging. Our robot, Striker, used a new drive system for us which gave each wheel a separate motor used window motors to turn the front and back wheels together. This allowed us to make tight turns and maneuver past defending robots to score. Though we built a pneumatic kicker that was quite effective, we mostly scored by "herding" or rolling soccer balls into the goals.\n\nThe UberBots had big plans for the 2010 season. Not only were we going to compete at 2 regionals for the first time ever, but we were planning to go for the Chairman''s Award. The Chairman''s award is the most prestigious Award given out by FIRST, to a team that spreads the message of FIRST, appreciation of science and technology, throughout their community. We had participated in many demos at schools and public places, and put together a video and an essay for the application.\n\nOur first regional was the WPI Regional. It was an early competition, so many teams, including us, were not in our prime. We only made it to the quarterfinals, where we were eliminated. However, we won the Chairman''s Award at WPI, even if we didn''t make it to the semifinals. We also won the Delphi Engineering Excellence Award for our robot''s elegant and simple design. The WPI Regional ended up going great, and it was good practice for our next event.\n\nThe Connecticut Regional was a fantastic event for the UberBots in 2010. We went undefeated throughout seeding and elimination matches, winning the competition on an alliance with Team 102 (The Gearheads) and Team 383 (Brazilian Machine). Since our robot was offensive, we scored high and also won the Coopertition award, which calculated points based on both our score and our opponents'' score after each match. We had also helped numerous teams on other alliances during the competition, which is part of the Coopertition award. Because of our complex drive system which allowed us to switch between a swerve drive for tight turns, a rotated drive for kicking, and other modes, we were again awarded the Rockwell Innovation in Control Award.\n\nThe UberBots again went to Atlanta to compete in the Championship. The competition was intense, and we were eliminated in the quarter finals of our division. However, we still placed well overall because our robot was able to score many balls quickly.\n'),

They are preselected prior to competition, and generally consist of a main team and a backup. The four members of the team include a first and second driver, a coach and a human player.
