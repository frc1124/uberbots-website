This is a great opportunity for the team to get some competition experience and will be a ton of fun. A tentative trip itinerary can be found <a href="http://uberbots.org/omni/media/files/Forms%20and%20Permission%20Slips/WPI%20Regional%20Tentative%20Itinerary.pdf">here</a>. The total cost for the trip will be $750. All students and mentors planning on attending should read that document and remember to turn in the first $250 deposit to a member of the Management Team by <b>kickoff</b> (January 5, 2013). Subsequently, a $500 payment will be due on 2/1/2013. For more information, contact a member of the Management Team or Mrs. Yost. Remember, if not enough people commit, the team can't attend.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><div>Some other upcoming events apart from the regular schedule:</div><div>- Friday January 4, 2013: <a href="http://uberbots.org/o/calendar?viewEvent&amp;eventId=381">Movie Night</a></div><div>- Saturday January 5, 2013: <a href="http://uberbots.org/o/calendar?viewEvent&amp;eventId=377">Kickoff!</a></div></div><div><br></div><div>Hope everyone had a good break and see you at tomorrow's meeting!</div><div><br></div><div>Thanks,</div><div>The Management Team</div><div><br></div><br/><p>This message was sent by the &Uuml;berBots mass email system.
