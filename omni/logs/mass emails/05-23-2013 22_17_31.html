<br>
<br>We have a few upcoming events the weekend.&nbsp; First, we have our Cosi 
night from 3 to 9 tomorrow, May 24th, where 10% of proceeds go to our team (order-in or 
take-out).&nbsp; Our team plans to meet at around 6 to eat together, but feel 
free to come any time between 3 and 9.
<br>
<br>Our team was also invited to attend a Memorial Day picnic, hosted by the 
Athena's Warriors (a local FIRST team).&nbsp; Several teams will be attending 
for BBQ, Ultimate Frisbee Tournament, Water Balloon Toss, Dance Party, 
Soccer, Badminton, and Athena's Warriors signature "Toss-Minton"
<br>
<br>The picnic is at Fern Park, West-Hartford, CT (567 Fern Street, West 
Hartford, CT, 06107) on Monday, starting at noon.&nbsp; Cost is $5.
<br>
<br>If you are interested in attending and were not on the list at tonight's 
meeting, comment on the forums, or contact Lauren before she RSVP's 
Friday night.&nbsp; Last changes to the list will be made at the Cosi dinner 
tomorrow.
<br>
<br>We hope to see you at the events.

<br>Thanks,
