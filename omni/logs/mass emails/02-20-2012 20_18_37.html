Tomorrow we will be meeting again from 4:00 PM to 9:00 PM so that we will be able to take final measurements before we bag the robot and get some real work done on the&nbsp; practice bot, which needs to be finished soon. Its been a long build season and its just one more push to get to the finish line!</P>
