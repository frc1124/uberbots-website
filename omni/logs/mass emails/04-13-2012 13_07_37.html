<h1>Mass Email Sent on 04-13-2012 13:07:37</h1><p><strong>Subject: </strong>Getting Rugs for Practice Space Tonight</p><br/><div>Team,<br><br>We are very excited about getting a new place to practice 
at OFS! However, we still need to take our rugs out of our previous 
practice space at 20 Security Drive. We have been given a very short 
window of time in which we're allowed to go back in the building to take
 them out. That window ends tomorrow, so it's extremely important that 
we have them by tonight. We ask that everyone who is available tonight 
at 5:30 to be at 20 Security Drive to help out! We need a lot of people 
as this isn't a small task!<br>
<br>We are still planning on having a meeting this Saturday at 1 to move
 things from the school to OFS, so please make sure you have your forms 
in!<br>Thank you,<br>The Management Team<br/><p>This message was sent by the &Uuml;berBots mass email system.
