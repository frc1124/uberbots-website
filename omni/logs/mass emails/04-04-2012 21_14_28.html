<p class="MsoNormal">Our offseason competitions are approaching quickly. If you
can attend either BattleCry@WPI (May 18-19), Beantown Blitz (June 2), or Where
Is Wolcott? (June 9), please <a href="http://uberbots.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=73&amp;t=12296&amp;p=12296">indicate this on the forums</a> by posting and voting
in the poll as soon as possible; the last day to do this will be one week from today
(4/11). The estimated cost for BattleCry@WPI will be between $100 and $150, and
will include food, lodging, and other accommodations.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Also, this afternoon, some of our team's mentors went to
visit our new practice space, donated by OFS. Located in Avon, this looks like
to be an awesome space, and we're very grateful for the donation. We are
looking to start moving into the space next week. We will meet next Tuesday
(4/10) from 7-9 and Saturday (4/14) from 1-5 PM. Meet at the High School, and
we will go from there. All team members must have the appropriate paperwork
filled out before they are allowed into the practice space.&nbsp; There will be no exceptions, and we will have
zero tolerance to breaking the rules. We will send out a link to the paperwork
in the upcoming days. Watch your emails. We will also need as many team members
as possible to move our belongings as efficiently as possible - please try to
be there.</p>
