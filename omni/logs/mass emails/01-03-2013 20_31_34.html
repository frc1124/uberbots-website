We ask all members to show up at 4:30 to help set up for the 5 o' clock event. Please wear your blue shirts and bring $5-10 as a donation and for food. Also, spread the word to your friends and family about this event to make it as successful as possible.</div><div><br></div><div>On Saturday January 5, we begin our build season with the FIRST Kickoff event. We ask all members, and parents interested in becoming mentors, to meet in the workshop by 8:45 with their blue shirts and $5 for lunch (you are more than welcome to bring your own lunch). Also, please bring sticky notes, pens, and whiteboard markers to take notes during the kickoff webcast. It is imperative that all members attend this event so that we can start the new season completely prepared.</div><div><br></div><div>Also, on Saturday, we ask all members to bring in their first $250 deposit for the WPI regional. As the number of the first deposits handed in increases, the cost of y second deposit will decrease. The WPI regional provides with an extra competitive opportunity as well as practice for the Hartford regional. This is a wonderful opportunity for members to get accustomed to the competitive atmosphere.</div><div><br></div><div>Here's to a wonderful and exciting build and competition season this year!</div><div><br></div><div>Thank You</div><div><br></div><div>The Management Team</div><div><br></div><br/><p>This message was sent by the &Uuml;berBots mass email system.
