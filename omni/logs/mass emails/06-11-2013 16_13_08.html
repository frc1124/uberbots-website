We must move our equipment out of OFS and into the school. The meeting that we currently have for &nbsp;<b>Thursday, June 13th (@ 6:30- 9 pm)</b>, has not been changed. If there is not enough time to move all of our materials, we will schedule another meeting to make up for the loss of today.</div><div><br></div><div>Thanks for the patience.</div><div>-The Management Team</div></div><br/><p>This message was sent by the &Uuml;berBots mass email system.
