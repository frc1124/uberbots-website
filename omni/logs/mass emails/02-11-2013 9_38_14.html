<h1>Mass Email Sent on 02-11-2013 9:38:14</h1><p><strong>Subject: </strong>Monday February 11 Meeting</p><br/><div>Hello Team,<div><br></div><div>Schools will not be in session on Monday February 11, however the high school will be open for us to use. Our meeting will be held from 9 am to 9 pm. Please bring in $5 for lunch and $10 for dinner, or bring your own for one or both. This&nbsp;will&nbsp;be a long meeting so the tendency to slack off will increase as we enter the late hours. However, to take full advantage of this extra time to make up for the lost weekend hours and to be ready for Suffield Shakedown on Saturday, it is crucial that everyone stay focused all throughout the meeting.</div><div><br></div><div>Again, the meeting on Monday February 11 will be held from 9 am to 9pm. Please bring money for lunch and dinner.</div><div><br></div><div>Thank you</div><div><br></div><div>The Management Team</div><br/><p>This message was sent by the &Uuml;berBots mass email system.
