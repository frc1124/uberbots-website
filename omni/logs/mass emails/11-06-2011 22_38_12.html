We have a fundraiser at Cosi this Tuesday, November 8th. Since everyone on the team should support this fundraiser, and given that there is no school on Tuesday and we have lots of things to discuss, we will have our team meeting at the restaurant! Please come to Cosi at 6pm on Tuesday, wearing your blue UberBots tshirt. Items we need to discuss include: championship, cleanup day, team building activity, and light bulb strategy. Please plan to attend, and don't forget to tell all your friends, neighbors, and family members to eat at Cosi on Tuesday night too.

Thanks,
