You can find the order form <a href="http://uberbots.org/omni/media/files/Forms%20and%20Permission%20Slips/2013%20Tshirt%20Order%20Form.pdf">here</a>. Please return the form and payment to Mrs .Yost or a member of the Management Team by 3/7/13.</div><div><br></div><div>Also, the team will need to make buttons for use at the regional. If people with access to a color printer could print out two or three copies of the <a href="http://uberbots.org/omni/media/files/Team%20Resources/Button%20Template.pdf">template</a>&nbsp;and bring them to a meeting, that will make the process much simpler.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Thanks,</div><div>The Management Team</div><br/><p>This message was sent by the &Uuml;berBots mass email system.
