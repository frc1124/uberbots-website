The Hartford Regional is a week away! If you plan on attending, you MUST FILL OUT the <a href="http://www.uberbots.org/omni/media/files/Forms%20and%20Permission%20Slips/Hartford%20Regional%20Permission%20Slip.pdf">Permission Slip</a>&nbsp;and return it to a member of the Managment Team <b>ASAP</b>.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>There is also one more form needed for the school district not previously mentioned that needs to be returned as soon as possible. This <a href="http://www.uberbots.org/omni/media/files/Forms%20and%20Permission%20Slips/District%20Travel%20Consent%20and%20Waiver%20Form.pdf">District Field Trip Form</a>&nbsp;is required for school activities.</div><div><br></div><div>From now until the Regional, all Team Meetings will take place at our OFS Practice Space at their regularly scheduled times (see the team <a href="http://www.uberbots.org/o/Calendar">Calendar</a> for more information).&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>This next weekend, we will also be attending a scrimmage at <a href="http://www.team195.com/">Team 195</a>'s Practice space. This is a great opportunity to run our robot in a more intense environment as well as network with other area teams in attendance. We will meet at OFS at the regular 8 AM to pack arrange carpools. Team members will need to pack their own lunch, as it will not be provided.</div><div><br></div><div>Thanks,</div><div>The Management Team</div><br/><p>This message was sent by the &Uuml;berBots mass email system.
