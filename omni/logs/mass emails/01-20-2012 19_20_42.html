Depending on conditions tomorrow morning, we will meet in the afternoon on Saturday (starting at 12 AM at the earliest). Tomorrow's meeting will&nbsp;<b>not</b>&nbsp;start at 8 AM.&nbsp;The best case scenario is that we will meet from 12 - 5 Saturday. However, this is pending a decision made tomorrow morning by school administration on whether or not (or when) to open the building. We will send out another update tomorrow morning with our plans, once the school makes a decision. Please keep an eye on your email for this important information.&nbsp;</div><div style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.917969); "><br></div><div style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.917969); ">On Sunday (1/22/12), we now have the building from 8 AM to 5 PM, and this time slot is guaranteed.

We'd like to stress that exams are very important, and we understand that studying takes time. However, we are at a very important time in our robot build, and we'd like to have as many members present at meetings this weekend (and the upcoming week) as possible. Please make the best use of your time so that both exams and robot building can succeed simultaneously.&nbsp;</div><div style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.917969); "><br></div><div style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.917969); ">In summary:&nbsp;<b>The meeting will not start at 8 AM tomorrow</b>.
