Our situation still does remain the same, we need to move our robots out of OFS into the high school as soon as possible. Future meetings will be decided shortly, stay tuned.</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Thanks,</div><div>The Management Team</div><br/><p>This message was sent by the &Uuml;berBots mass email system.
