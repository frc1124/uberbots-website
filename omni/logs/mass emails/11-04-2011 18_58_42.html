<h1>Mass Email Sent on 11-04-2011 18:58:42</h1><p><strong>Subject: </strong>Cleanup Day Cancelled</p><br/><div>Team,<div><br></div><div>Due to the face that the High School being used as an emergency shelter for people&nbsp;displaced&nbsp;by the storm, the cleanup day originally scheduled for tomorrow, November 5, has been cancelled. The school has decided that all activities are cancelled while the building is being used as a shelter, so we will be unable to hold our meeting. It will be rescheduled to another day during the next team meeting. Stay warm and safe.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Thanks,</div><div>The Management Team</div><br/><p>This message was sent by the &Uuml;berBots mass email system.
