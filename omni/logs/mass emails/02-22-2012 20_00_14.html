<p class="MsoNormal">Yesterday was the end of our Build Session. We have
officially bagged our robot! For the next five weeks, we will be practicing
driving and getting ready for the Northeast Utilities CT Regional on March
29-31.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Even though the official build season is over, we would like
to emphasize that the work is not yet done. Members are still requested and
expected to show up to the daily and weekend meetings to finish building the
practice robot, prepare for CT Regional, and put together the Chairmanâ€™s Award
Binder. Also, Team 195, the Cyberknights, has invited us to several practice
sessions and scrimmages at their field, which we need to prepare for as well.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Meetings will still be held Mondays through Thursdays from
6:30pm to 9pm, Saturdays from 8am to 5pm, and Sundays from 12pm to 5pm. Please attend
as many meetings as you can. <o:p></o:p></p>
