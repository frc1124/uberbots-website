<br>
Some of the dates and times are different than what was on the whiteboard.<br>
The Pine Grove Lego contest judging (Thursday) will start at 3:40, not 
2:40 as we originally said. &nbsp;However, on Friday we are still presenting 
awards at 2:40.<br>
The May Fair, which we had on the board as Saturday, is actually on Sunday from 12:30 to 4:30.<br>
<br>
As a reminder, we also have the Pine Grove Picnic at 5:00 on Friday where we will demo the robots.<br>
Please try to attend as many events as you can and wear your blue team shirt.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;Please comment on the forums if you can make these new dates/times. Sorry for the confusion.<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>
